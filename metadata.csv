Abstract

Aerial imagery is used for applications such as urban planning, monitoring and surveillance. An important task is object detection, and proposed detection techniques tune models in the framework. Proposed object detection framework concerning whole image processing would scale gracefully, especially in real year practice, in data augmentation and a broad variety of scale and detection of objects in aerial images. We propose multi object detection transformer for optical detection, prefers multi scale, feature extraction and reprocessing in reactive granulated output garment training and detection, updating testing steps improving resultant and informative the efficiency of the general processing efficiency, must be ensuring and rendering for detection across scales.

Abstract

Image matching introduces a precision method for matching semantic between images using GNN techniques in scenes. Instead, a GNN based approach leverages the anatomical relationships between keypoints and outperforms transitional methods and recent deep learning models.

Introduction

Image matching is a fundamental task in computer vision, solving the task of identifying point correspondences between two or more images. Applications include reconstruction, visualization, and image registration, among others. Moreover, these methods are to cope with complex challenges such as graph construction.

Traditional methods proposed vision using SIFT, while recent deep learning techniques rely on convolutional neural networks to extract features from images. Recent deep learning techniques rely on convolutional neural networks that learn relationships.

Prior studies have shown deep learning based architectures are changed performance improvements over other combinations experimental results.

Abstract

Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly increased the performance of multi-view 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an instantiated 3D representation. Our proposed approach presents an alignment of images registered into a coherent 3D representation.


The method introduces a 3D regression for aligning multi-view images to form 3D meshes. The method integrates features extracted with dense modeling.

1 Introduction

The task of reconstructing 3D objects from multi-images is necessary and provides insights in applications in computational vision, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods require exhaustive modeling and depth estimation through conventional techniques. Deep learning has significantly improved the performance of these codes by leveraging multi-scale and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, proposed deep learning systems play major roles involving encoder-decoder architectures and dense regression.

Our key contributions include an end-to-end learning framework, a refinement loss alignment approach, enabling multi-view information integration, and demonstrating state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

2 Introduction

Second comparison of approaches to multi-view 3D reconstruction

2.1 Multi-View Stereo (MVS)

Traditional MVS methods build upon classical MVS techniques comparing dense reconstructions, volume mapping, and image matching, requiring manual calibration and consistency to obtain activation information. These approaches can be applied to different scenes and scales with results on benchmark metrics.

In recent approaches, proposed pipelines provide incremental building of iterative depth estimation, and combine diverse rates of results to improve accuracy.

2 Related Work

Reviews existing approaches to multi-view 3D reconstruction and advanced approaches.

2.1 Multi-View Stereo (MVS)

Traditional MVS methods present classical exploration governing principles and density map extraction from multiple images. Over time, convolutional networks, deep methods such as CNNs enable robust estimation and provide strong representation using internal image features. All neural approaches have achieved significant performance improvements. We apply high-level features for multi-view alignment and surface reconstruction based on formation.

2.2 Learning-based Approaches

Recent advances in architectures address declines in sparse data. Deep learning methods allow new CNNs to reconstruct multi-view textures and visual configurations that learn robust features. Implementation of these sequence networks enables multi-scale evaluation and improves the risk of input images being misaligned.

Abstract

Learning proposes a novel model for detecting out-of-distribution patterns in images using deep neural networks. To set a constant implication of differentiating the importance of OOD detection versus in-distribution (ID) expectations for detection has enabled applications. Deploying in heuristic applications calls for scalable detection methods and new object recognition methods to identify objects specifically learned representations generally. Experimental results show improved performance over existing methods, to provide efficient results.

1 Introduction

Deep neural networks are extensively used in computer vision and many benchmarking problems and some large responsibilities. With object detection in desired, identifying the difficulties of identifying OOD objects is of practical importance to robust filtering networks. In practice, deep neural selection methods previously constrain scalable OOD detection in the representation of each object and the example only focus on object-level OOD detection of prediction.

1 Introduction

Maximizing recent use of importance in computer vision is the robustness capability of objects. OOD occurrence can be characterized by the discovery of neural information. Opposed approaches are failing to identify inner-OOD exclusion effects in objects such as interpretations. Some evolving methods, heuristic methods more effective, frame discussion, but frequently provide important insights which each the image level, we experiment to object-level OOD detection.

Abstract

Abstract presents a novel Progressive Representation
Learning (PRL) approach for unsupervised domain
adaptation. PRL leverages effective improvements, reducing
the discrepancy between source and target domains.
Feature representations are progressively aligned through
adversarial learning with a probabilistic labeling strategy,
improving representation refinement steps. In extensive
experiments on benchmarked domain adaptation,
PRL outperforms baseline and current methods, and
provides supporting visualizations for improved
successful domain alignment.

1. Introduction

Domain adaptation in computer vision typically
assumes access to a labeled source domain and an
unlabeled target domain. Significant distribution
discrepancies between source and target degrade
performance. Previous methods focus on aligning
feature distributions, such as adversarial training,
discrepancy minimization, and self training.
This paper introduces the PRL approach, which
performs progressive refinement of feature
representations for domain alignment, and
comprehensive evaluations indicate strong performance
on common benchmarks.

2. Related Work

Prior research on unsupervised domain representation
learning and representation adaptation has categorized
domain adaptation methods primarily into
distribution based and self training approaches.
Progressive representation learning methods
provide rich feature representations through
convolutional and contrastive learning.
Advancements focus on achieving compact,
discriminative features.

3. Progressive Representation Learning

We outline the PRL approach, beginning with
a base stage. Stage 1 of PRL operates on the
base signals, where the base model is trained on
labeled source domain data to extract robust
feature representations. Subsequent stages
iteratively refine these features, resulting in
large progressive performance gains.

L(θ_s, θ_t) = x_0 (1)

Equation (1) defines the cross entropy loss between
source features y_s(x_i) and y_t(x_i) and source labels y_i.

3. Progressive Representation Learning

The PRL approach begins with Stage 1, where a
base model is trained on labeled source domain data
to extract initial feature representations. It then
interprets and refines these feature representations.
On unlabeled target data, we adopt the first step
of progressive adaptation.

Abstract

We want to develop a joint representation for visual and textual information, combining visual features from images with textual semantics from accompanying text. Using a dual-encoder architecture, supervision with contrastive learning enables better alignment of visual and textual modalities, improved performance in visual question answering and image-text retrieval tasks, and comparison.

1 Introduction

Visual and textual modality integration in joint interactions improves comprehensibility for visual images, addressing early interactions focused on independent achievements. We assume that a dual encoder architecture makes distilling visual and textual information into paired image-text inputs.

In recent concerns, approaches to multimodal learning train multimodal models, especially providing evidence related to learning total requirements for effectiveness of these approaches, prioritizing alignment.

Although approaches to multimodal representation emerge, the area continues to rise.

Early approaches to multimodal learning to integrate mutual on larger image-text index approaches via IDI emerge transformers as well as enhancement of contrastive learning objectives with attention.

Abstract

Language guided video inpainting method leverages role-play missing content in video based on textual descriptions. This proposed approach leverages prediction models that form natural-to-content synthesis on visual inference. We increase a contrast conditional approach as the conditioning on language input. Extensive evaluation and average performance demonstrate improvements in the category of research oriented text guided inpainting methods. In this context, challenges and comprehensive solutions are discussed, introducing comprehensive experiments in video synthesis.

1 Introduction

Video inpainting is an unfilled task and a precisely challenging problem. Decomposing samples loses information, making it difficult to develop transformation networks. We examine the insertion of a novel approach to deploy the challenges of video inpainting methods. For example, supplementation of semantic relations in language based operations creates a result in the desired performance of a model identifying a better optimizing wave. We efficiently model data as supervised tasks implying techniques. Supporting innovative robustness allows the model to have control over inpainted content by constraints.

2 Related Work

Recent advances in understanding processes in various inpainting research served as pivotal to enter development. Traditional deep learning based methods include diffusion models and other operation mechanisms that construct temporal consistency and reflection based proposals, while learning based methods.

Abstract

A novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation approach with temporal consistency, listing spatial image reconstruction and temporal depth consistency between consecutive frames for supervision, introduces a temporal consistency loss aligning depth predictions across time. Extensive experiments are conducted on experimentation to investigating temporal consistency made to improve stable and accurate depth predictions under dynamic scenes.

1. Introduction

Monocular depth estimation is a critical computer vision task. Self-supervised methods leverage photometric image reconstruction between stereo pairs of temporal video sequences. It introduces challenges with using dynamic changes in the image across time. Proposed is temporal consistency constraint to regularize depth estimation across frames. Importantly:

1. Introduce a temporal consistency loss constraint
2. Demonstrates integration with existing self-supervised frameworks
3. Present experimental results or existing insights on improved depth estimation

Related Work

Abstract

We introduce a novel approach to motion prediction based on neural motion fields (NMFs). NMFs model the future positions of agents as continuous functions over time, predicted by neural networks that directly learn future motion fields. To enhance the prediction accuracy, we propose an aggregated sampling that samples multiple future trajectories along each velocity field, using the aggregated trajectories to make a final prediction. Our method avoids the hierarchical nature of prior approaches, making a significantly faster algorithm. Through extensive experiments on standard trajectory prediction benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods on various metrics while maintaining low inference times.

Abstract

Learning a novel method for multi-object tracking (MOT) using weak annotations, i.e. subset bounding boxes without unique object identities. We see a self-supervised contrastive representation learning approach to multi-instance consistent identity through appearance invariant representations. It acts as a marker with a siamese network architecture that combines appearance embeddings with motion information for experimental modules, thus verifying the weak annotation efficacy of our self-supervised approach.

Introduction

Multi object tracking (MOT) is a core challenge. Supervised methods rely on large datasets of annotated data with unique object identifiers. Weak annotations reduce this burden. We propose a self-supervised contrastive learning approach to provide a robust appearance-based representation learning for weak annotations.

1 Contributions

The proposed approach uses weak annotations.

The motion modeling generates motion embeddings using the past T object states as a tracklet.

A contrastive loss is employed to encourage positive pairs while discouraging negative pairs:

Abstract

A framework for generating human motion sequences from textual descriptions using autoregressive models based on a transformer architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies and motion dynamics, providing critical results to normalized field modes of less qualitative results. Qualitative results demonstrate comprehensive solution, improvement, and evaluation compared to prior motion, as an innovative solution for text driven motion synthesis.

Figure 1. Overview of our proposed framework for generating human motion from textual descriptions.

Introduction

In the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, there is a rapid contribution to generating human motion from textual descriptions. Approaches covering challenges such as ambiguity and variability in language specifying motion or visual queries. The paper proposes contributions structured as a natural approach. We developed a joint concept to sequence model and orchestrating comparative performance compared to existing methods.

Method

More model architecture is an autoregressive model. Task is text generation, the pre-trained language model encodes formal descriptions into embeddings. The motion sequences are processed into the sequence of progressively generated motion to produce a next motion representation. Cross-attention mechanisms align the text-derived embeddings within motion representations.

Loss Function

Supervised learning objectives for training motion generation model. The generated motion sequence is trained with the generation conditions by minimization of loss between the predicted and actual motion representations.

1. Introduction

Model architecture defines an autoregressive model with a transformer-based architecture. Text encoder utilizes a pre-trained language model to encode textual descriptions into embeddings. A classifier-like network aligns text-defined embeddings with motion embeddings, producing sequence consistency and alignment within sequence-to-sequence modeling.

A concise approach cross-assignment is converged and manually aligning the generated text-driven motion sequences.","References

Abstract

ObjectFormer, a novel object detection architecture, utilizes the Transformer model to detect objects in images. The model uses a set of object queries processed through a Transformer encoder-decoder network, extracting hierarchical features in the image. The decoder iteratively refines object queries to generate predictions.

1 Introduction

Object detection is a crucial application in important emerging applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and image understanding.

In recent years, we invert Transformer based architectures, originally used in natural language processing, for implementing object detection. We propose an overview of ObjectFormer, its source object queries, and adjustments throughout the decoding process.

Abstract

Self-supervised depth estimation suffers from limitations for depth estimation. In self-supervised depth estimation, photometric loss functions can be affected by lighting invariants, providing to the alignment space. We propose feature distillation to enhance depth predictions by distilling feature representations from a pre-trained teacher model. The present method uses a convolutional encoder-decoder student model to predict dense depth maps from monocular video while aligning intermediate features with the teacher network. Results indicate that this method surpasses previous self-supervised methods and aligns it closely with fully supervised algorithms.

Introduction

Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a robust paradigm aiming to strengthen feature representations using predicted depth predictions.

Introduction

Abstract

Semantic image segmentation has gained vigorous focus for semantic image segmentation, which requires effective predictions for assessment in semantic vision. This work introduces a new segmentation method in visual spectrations (CNNs). Our new approach includes a new segmentation module that refines the feature line of patch methodology and multi-scale activation layers, contributing to favorable rotation and robustness of operations in difficult conditions. We demonstrate evaluations on benchmark datasets such as ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO-Stuff, and experimental results show state-of-the-art performance compared to convolutional networks and other vision transformer-based methods.

1 Introduction

Semantic image segmentation is enabling scene semantics, a central task of pattern recognition in computer vision. Though it has been difficult to approach using convolutional neural networks, as semantic segmentation confers contextual localization in estimation. There are also estimates of most segmentation features, modality, and saliency, embedded in multi-leveled environments. For this application the control is our coring approach. We propose the contributions:

• a new approach in segmentation.
• attention-based construction layers for global sub-extracting and multi-scale feature extraction for semantic extraction.
• experiments on standard segmentation benchmarks.

Implicit Fields

Abstract

3D shape reconstruction from images in recent years has seen rapid development. Reconstruction is a fundamental problem for reconstruction from tragged images, using scalable networks to learn implicit surface representations and precisely specify the extent of shape and depth. Deep implicit constructions are indeed still challenging, yet this approach is strong and emerging, utilizing implicit surface representations. This uses DNNs to map images into implicit structure representations, accommodating the assigned or sampled distances. This optimally addresses accuracy and improves detail.

Introduction

3D shape reconstruction from images contributes to many things in computer vision and graphics such as modeling and device shape reconstruction. Single-view reconstruction from different angles and single view templates have been explored extensively. Compared to traditional shape representation, deep implicit representations perform improved constructions.

2 Deep Implicit Field Framework
2.1 Implicit Function

Implicit function is the continuous representation as a continuous function f(x, y, z) that learns to define the signed distance or occupancy expressed by computing outputs.

2.2 Network Architecture

A convolutional neural network encodes an input image into a latent code representation, followed by a multilayer perceptron for reconstruction output.

Abstract

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method for person re-identification (re-ID) that enables deep learning techniques. In only supervised-based re-ID models to new domains, applying supervised person matching models to new contexts remains complex. We combine feature alignment via adversarial normalization and self-training. Experimental results on standard person re-ID show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

1 Introduction

Person re-identification (re-ID) plays a crucial role in video surveillance.

Deep learning models often suffer from domain shift between source and target domains for generalization.

We propose a UDA approach for cross-domain re-ID that includes two stages: feature alignment learning via adversarial training and a self-training strategy to refine the target domain model efficiently.

A novel image compression method based on adaptive context modulation. We propose a novel image compression effect extending and optimized strategies to optimize latent based entropy models. We enhance calibration in adaptive entropy information to the ability to adjust the context through memory, which analysis demonstrates higher performance and enhanced superior efficiency.

Introduction

Learned image compression recent advances include adaptive image compression, can solve learning nonlinear searches for nonlinear transform control. In addition, in efficient entropy coding, many methodologies involve challenges to robust conditional entropy models to enhance context sensitivity for higher compression efficiency.

Related Work

Traditional context based entropy models suggested, however, learned image compression methods and the driving context has recently constructed significant core approaches. Such utilization in predictive coded approaches, such as the nearest learned image compression dynamics, reduce decompression bringing spatial and channel wise approaches. We characterize extensive expense of learned image compression approaches to high amounts for better compression efficiency in context.

Measurements, such as regular LP linear predictive coding approaches, on techniques such as attention mechanisms, are used to model spatial and channel wise dependencies through attention mechanisms.

Segmentation

Abstract
Addressing open vocabulary instance segmentation is an emerging, difficult task for detecting and segmenting objects in novel instances not seen during training. The proposed overall framework combines a vision-language model with a region-based segmentation model to match specifically open vocabulary objects. Our method broadly improves supports the framework and adapts the outputs into prototype-level representations by learning persistent environments in the mixture of all prior approaches. Results exhibit segmentation improvements and demonstrate the ability to segment novel objects, scalable across datasets such as COCO and ADE20K, illustrating the ability to segment novel objects reliably.

1 Introduction
Figure 1. Examples of open vocabulary instance segmentation results. For example, open vocabulary instance segmentation is only efficient when dealing with the challenge of open-set segmentation in the structure outputs of the real world, and as an approach to introduce the vision-language model and segmentation model.

2 Experiments
Evaluating the proposed method on COCO and ADE20K datasets. Our proposed method is evaluated on COCO test sets. To evaluate, the detailed assessment method segments random novel instances not specifically annotated during training. Representations from image-vision pairs are used, while the segmentation model produces predictions. The integrated loss includes the mask predictions on the visual-language model in adjusting the mask prediction process.

Methodology
The proposed open vocabulary instance segmentation includes the ability to describe and segment not registered proposals. It provides a method where a model language model retrieves visual representations from segmentation models, showing the way of extracting two places to provide experimental instance segmentation.

Low-light image enhancement can generate absolute image enhancement. In traditional low-light image problems, generative using instance diffusion models consists of advanced models, such as diffusion image enhancement choices. High-quality photorealistic images in low-light conditions.

Insights

1 Introduction

Panorama image construction remains complex and commonly suffers from misalignment and component discontinuities. Existing stereo and panorama stitching approaches rely on alignment and post-processing utilities for blending output.

Input  Global Adaptive Alignment
Input images → [PEE] → Local Alignment
Figure 2: Pipeline of our proposed blind panorama stitching method.

2 Approach

Combining a global approach only optimizing on methodical approximation improves stitching methods. This approach integrates robustness and adaptive focal alignment.

Approach

Modern panorama stitching methods are monolithic, but shortcomings arise in handling overlapping simple methods on global panorama alignment. Existing methods incorporate surface model local alignment, enabling adaptive alignment and visual correction.

2 Approach

Approach addresses hierarchical global motion estimation and adaptive local alignment. Methods are combined for application using geometric constraints as well as alignment error and visual consistency.

2 Conclusion

We introduce and propose a blind panorama stitching method, focusing on robust and adaptive alignment to improve clarity and consistency while reducing visual artifacts and alignment errors.

Abstract

A novel approach for image inpainting using structure-guided diffusion models. Traditional inpainting methods struggle with large missing regions. Some frameworks propagate structure information in the masked regions to guide the denoising process of a diffusion model to improve performance against baseline approaches.

1 Introduction

Image inpainting is challenging in the goal of image enhancement with large missing regions, creating problems that are particularly difficult to solve. Deep learning methods and new techniques integrate structural information into inpainting, demonstrating the importance of structure information processing.

1 Introduction

Image inpainting is a proposed approach using experimentation on large masked regions. On ensuring hidden regions using large missing regions, this combines the approach to increasingly inpaint large masked regions.

Abstract

A proposed deep learning framework for semantic segmentation in challenging environments, including varying illumination, blurring, distortion, and feature inconsistencies. Our method computes assembled features and leverages perceptual consistency to improve segmentation accuracy. It generalizes to unseen scenarios and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving stable segmentation across diverse datasets, despite complex contextual variations. The proposed system consistently outperforms baseline methods and improves segmentation reliability in large-scale environments.

1 Introduction

Semantic segmentation in computer vision is an essential yet challenging task. It involves pixel-level classification and requires robust modeling to handle variations in texture, lighting, occlusion, and perspective. Existing solutions often struggle with inconsistent boundaries and complex visual patterns. We propose a unified deep learning approach that integrates multiscale contextual information and adaptive refinement mechanisms to enhance segmentation precision. Our method improves generalization and maintains robustness across different scenes and conditions.

2 Related Work

Previous research has explored various techniques for semantic segmentation, including fully convolutional networks, encoder-decoder architectures, and attention-based models. These approaches have improved performance but still face limitations in handling domain shifts and fine-grained segmentation details. Recent advances combine contextual aggregation with feature pyramids to improve boundary accuracy, yet challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across diverse datasets.

4 Experiments

The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements over existing methods. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show enhanced accuracy, stability, and robustness. The model effectively handles complex scenarios and outperforms competing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics, confirming its superiority in semantic segmentation tasks.

anpe-","Deep Learning for Robust Image Super-Resolution


Abstract

Image super-resolution is a fundamentally challenging image enhancement problem that aims to recover high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Traditional interpolation techniques often struggle with restoring fine textures and high-frequency details, resulting in blurry and artifact-prone outputs. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated significant improvements by learning complex mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution image spaces.

In this paper, we propose a robust deep learning framework for image super-resolution that leverages convolutional neural networks to enhance image quality while preserving structural and perceptual details. Our model integrates multi-scale feature extraction and residual learning to improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional and existing deep learning-based approaches, achieving sharper edges and more realistic textures.

Introduction

Image super-resolution focuses on reconstructing high-resolution images from low-resolution sources. This problem is critical in applications such as satellite imaging, medical diagnostics, surveillance, and digital photography. Traditional methods such as bicubic interpolation fail to recover lost high-frequency information, leading to oversmoothed results.

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled models to learn complex representations for reconstructing fine image details. However, challenges remain in preserving both global structure and local texture consistency. Our proposed approach addresses these limitations by combining feature hierarchy learning with adaptive reconstruction strategies, resulting in improved visual fidelity and robustness.

Related Work

Early super-resolution approaches relied on interpolation and example-based learning techniques. These methods provided limited improvements and were unable to generalize well across diverse image domains. The emergence of convolutional neural networks introduced significant advancements, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textures and edges.

State-of-the-art models incorporate residual learning, attention mechanisms, and adversarial training. While these methods improve performance, they still struggle with real-world noise and structural distortions. Our work builds upon these advances by introducing a more stable and robust architecture.

Proposed Method

The proposed framework consists of a deep convolutional neural network structured around residual and multi-scale feature learning blocks. The model extracts hierarchical features from the input image and progressively reconstructs high-resolution outputs through upsampling layers and reconstruction modules.

Key components include:

Multi-scale feature extraction for capturing both global and local details

Residual connections to stabilize training and preserve image structure

Adaptive refinement layers to enhance texture consistency

The network is trained using a combination of pixel-wise loss and perceptual loss to balance accuracy and visual realism.

Experiments

Experiments were conducted on standard benchmark datasets commonly used in super-resolution evaluation. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements in PSNR and SSIM metrics compared to baseline methods. Visual comparisons further highlight sharper edges, reduced artifacts, and improved texture clarity.

Figure 2. Experimental results for image super-resolution

Conclusion

This work presents a robust deep learning-based framework for image super-resolution that significantly improves image reconstruction quality. By integrating multi-scale representation learning and adaptive refinement, the model achieves superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Future work will explore real-time deployment and further optimization for larger image resolutions.

Abstract
Deep learning approaches have overtaken conventional segmentation paradigms for semantic segmentation. The power of deep learning attention for image segmentation is presented into their taxonomy, including fully supervised, weakly supervised and semi-supervised segmentation methods, including region proposal methods, feature reuse, and discriminative attention mechanisms. We review architectures, highlight representative approaches, discuss benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols, and summarize current challenges and future research directions.

1. Introduction

Visual information is growing in power. The emergence of convolutional and deep learning approaches to segmentation remains dominant since the introduction of modern computational models. Deep CNN-based approaches have become central for digitized-grain segmentation and image-level recognition techniques. Recent advancements emphasize adaptive parameters and refined end-to-end pipelines across dynamic scenarios.

2. Regional Models

Image segmentation has seen consistent significant progress, observations of specific region-based reception or successive convolution refinement for the supervision field. Dense segmentation shows consistent improvements across benchmark datasets.

3. Discussion

Modern frameworks for image segmentation combine discriminative and generative pipelines, yielding stronger prediction stability. Challenges remain in shape-understanding and boundary refinement.

4. Unsupervised Methods

Unsupervised segmentation techniques have increased interest in recent years.

2. Fully Supervised Methods

Image segmentation has produced reliable predictions and yields large datasets of annotated ground truth labels.

Classification

Abstract

One-shot image classification is a challenging due to large data dimensionality and difficulties in generalization across diverse domains. Siamese networks are introduced, a model that compares the input images and learns a similarity metric between pairs. The Siamese network framework embeds images into a shared feature space and then computes a distance function to determine similarity. The architecture enables discrimination between classes even with very limited training samples, achieving higher accuracy in over-classification tasks.

For practical evaluation, a forward-pass model is employed and tested on a benchmark dataset and demonstrates its effectiveness in one-shot classification scenarios.

1. Introduction

In one-shot image analysis, learning a robust similarity function from only a few examples remains difficult. Traditional image classification methods rely on large annotated datasets, whereas Siamese networks focus on metric learning to match unseen inputs based on learned representations. This method allows efficient comparison between image pairs and improves classification accuracy under sparse data conditions. The challenge remains balancing generalization and discrimination when limited samples are available.

3 Method

The architecture processes input image pairs through twin networks that share weights and extract comparable feature representations. These features are then compared using a distance metric to determine similarity or dissimilarity. This approach reduces dependency on extensive labeled datasets and allows effective learning under limited supervision.

Public implementation demonstrates minimal training requirements while maintaining competitive performance.

5 Conclusion

The proposed Siamese network framework is consistent and reliable for one-shot image classification tasks, achieving strong performance with limited training data.

Figure 1. Siamese network architecture.

3 Method

We define a step-based architecture composed of operation layers that process each image through identical subnetworks. These subnetworks extract features and compare them via a similarity function. The output determines whether the pair belongs to the same class based on a learned threshold.

The estimation maintains bounded model complexity and generalizes across unseen classes with minimal retraining.

Figure 1. Accuracy of one-shot image classification.

5 Experiments

Proposed experiments demonstrate consistent evaluation on common benchmarks and validate improved comparison performance across unseen classes. Results indicate enhanced robustness and stability in classification accuracy.

In conclusion, the Siamese model effectively addresses the one-shot classification challenge with competitive results.

Abstract

Semantic segmentation is a challenging task requiring accurate pixel-level annotation and extensive manual labeling. We propose a self-supervised learning framework for semantic segmentation that leverages unlabeled image data to learn meaningful feature representations without explicit supervision. Our approach utilizes proxy tasks and consistency regularization to guide the learning process, enabling robust segmentation performance across diverse scenarios. This method reduces dependency on large labeled datasets and demonstrates promising results in various benchmarks.

1 Introduction

Semantic segmentation is an important component in computer vision. However, it has been resource intensive and requires significant annotation efforts. Existing approaches often rely on supervised learning with extensive labeled data. This motivates the need for self-supervised techniques that can exploit structure in unlabeled data. We explore a novel approach leveraging consistency constraints and region-based representation learning to improve segmentation accuracy while minimizing labeling requirements.

2 Related Work

Early methods based on classical computer vision techniques relied on hand-crafted features and heuristic segmentation strategies. With the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural networks have achieved notable success in segmentation tasks. However, most approaches remain heavily dependent on labeled data. Recent research explores unsupervised and weakly supervised methods to reduce annotation costs, but challenges persist in achieving comparable performance to fully supervised models.

3 Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation

The proposed approach for self-supervised semantic segmentation integrates contrastive learning and region consistency to generate reliable segmentation maps. By enforcing consistency across augmented views and leveraging learned representations, the model achieves improved generalization. The framework adapts to various image distributions and demonstrates resilience to noise and domain shifts.



Textual document portion describes recent advancements in deep semantic learning and outlines a variety of visual representation strategies using proxy supervision and region-level inference. The method applies constraints across scales and integrates adaptive consistency learning to facilitate semantic understanding across unrelated domains.

4 Experiments

Empirical evaluation of the proposed method on benchmark datasets demonstrates improved resilience and stability. The segmentation accuracy shows consistent gains across datasets with minimal supervised input. Results indicate that the proposed framework yields strong generalization capacity.

Fig. 1. Overview of the proposed self-supervised learning approach.

5 Conclusion

This paper presents a thorough self-supervised semantic segmentation framework that effectively reduces reliance on labeled data. The method achieves reliable segmentation outcomes by leveraging structural consistency and learning from unlabeled sources. Future work includes exploring additional proxy tasks and improving scalability for large-scale image datasets.

Abstract

We propose a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for scalable object detection that improves robustness across varying object scales through efficient multi resolution feature utilization. The method constructs a pyramid of features at multiple resolutions using a top down pathway with lateral connections. This design enables strong semantic feature representation at all levels of the pyramid. The proposed FPN demonstrates improved detection accuracy and efficiency on benchmark datasets, particularly for small and medium sized objects.

Introduction

Traditional object detection models often struggle to accurately detect objects that vary significantly in size. Convolutional neural networks extract hierarchical features, but deeper layers tend to lose spatial detail that is critical for small object detection. Recent approaches attempt to address this problem using multi scale modeling, yet these methods often lack effective feature fusion across scales.

The Feature Pyramid Network introduces a structured approach that constructs a rich multi scale feature hierarchy from a single backbone network. By combining high level semantic information with lower level spatial detail, FPN improves detection performance for objects of diverse scales.

Methodology

The proposed method constructs a pyramid of features by integrating a backbone CNN with a top down pathway and lateral connections. High level feature maps are upsampled and merged with corresponding lower level feature maps to create semantically strong representations at every scale.

This allows the detection head to operate on feature maps that are both spatially precise and semantically rich. The network therefore achieves reliable performance across small, medium, and large objects.

Architecture

The FPN architecture consists of:

A backbone CNN responsible for initial feature extraction.

A top down pathway that propagates semantic information to higher resolution layers.

Lateral connections that fuse deep and shallow feature maps.

This design results in a pyramid of feature maps where each level contributes to object detection at a specific scale.

Experimental Results

The FPN model demonstrates superior performance on standard detection benchmarks. Results show improved accuracy for small objects without sacrificing performance on larger ones. The method also maintains computational efficiency, making it suitable for real time applications.

Figure 1 shows detection results across different object scales using the proposed FPN.
Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the Feature Pyramid Network and its integration with a backbone CNN.

Conclusion

The Feature Pyramid Network provides an effective solution for multi scale object detection by leveraging a hierarchical pyramid of features. Through top down fusion and lateral integration, it delivers consistent and reliable detection across varying object sizes. This approach enhances both accuracy and scalability, making it well suited for complex real world detection scenarios.

Abstract

This paper explores the application of Transformer models to the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, where the goal is to generate an answer to a question based on a given image. We propose a Transformer based architecture that jointly processes visual and textual modalities using multi modal attention mechanisms. The model enables effective cross modality interaction and improved contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on standard VQA datasets demonstrate strong performance gains. Future extensions and possible applications are also discussed.

Introduction

Visual Question Answering is a fundamental challenge that lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Transformer based models have shown strong capability in sequence modeling and contextual representation. Their application to VQA enables more effective fusion strategies and improved feature interaction. This work evaluates different structural and fusion configurations and highlights their impact on performance.

Transformer Based Architecture

2.1 Image and Text Feature Extraction

Image features are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network denoted as x_img. Text features are encoded using a Transformer based language encoder denoted as x_txt. These features are processed independently to preserve modality specific characteristics.

The extracted representations are passed into a Transformer encoder that allows cross modality interaction and produces a contextualized joint representation z.

2.2 Multi Modal Fusion

We use a multi modal Transformer to combine x_img and x_txt through attention mechanisms. This module learns meaningful relationships between visual regions and textual tokens, generating a unified semantic representation that is used for answer prediction.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture. Visual and textual features are processed separately and then fused using the multi modal Transformer encoder to generate the final answer.

Ablation Studies

We conduct ablation experiments to evaluate the contribution of different architectural components such as:

Removal of cross attention layers

Replacement of Transformer encoder with simple concatenation

Variation in attention heads and depth

Results show that cross modality attention plays a critical role in achieving high accuracy and semantic consistency.

Experimental Results

Experiments were conducted on standard VQA benchmarks. The proposed model consistently outperformed baseline CNN RNN based approaches and demonstrated robust performance across multiple question categories.

Conclusion

This work demonstrates the effectiveness of Transformer based architectures for Visual Question Answering. By leveraging structured multi modal attention, the model achieves superior understanding of both image content and question semantics. Future work includes scaling the model to larger multimodal datasets and exploring reasoning based VQA tasks.

Abstract. A framework for generating consistent depth maps from stereo maps joints. The most accepted approach to generating consistent depth maps due to poor densification and illumination variations. An improved robust iterative proposed method defines an optimization-based approach based on a novel network architecture and refinement strategy. It also provides quantitative evaluation on experiments across different datasets.

INTRODUCTION

Estimating accurate depth maps is adaptive to accurate applications. In computer vision, while most design focuses on the importance of estimating essential depth maps, depth is difficult in different applications. In fact, most applications struggle with the challenge. Prior consensus approaches use observing consistent approaches to estimate depth maps collaboratively on coherence and performance across sequential methods. In this approach, expanding basic methods remains challenging for particularizing depth approaches through emitting multiple considerable refinement strategy objectives to optimize efficiency.

INTRODUCTION

Network Architecture

A stereo matching network consists of feature extraction with direct components. Framing resolution, shared convolutional layers used for depth estimation. Existing network provides computed scoring layers by Iₗ and Iᵣ, producing texture maps gₗ and gᵣ, and constructs a cost volume X, the disparity between corresponding pixels of disparity between corresponding planes of disparity.

Methodology Approach

For stereo matching network, preliminary a local segmentation network combining three time components, fusing a selection of loss solutions, construction, and depth estimation. This algorithm is believed is used to construct the cost volume C, using from the decoding background, bringing refinement between conventional iterative methods.

Refinement module aims to enforce cross-view consistency between initial depth maps obtained by decoder. The difference map is computed, Fₗ and Fᵣ for the left and right view, including the disparity between initial depth network predicted depth counterparts. The refined depth deployment is reinstated by applying a refinement network f to the dₗ and dᵣ.

Consistency refinement module is to enforce cross-view consistency between refined depth maps, while obtaining it by decoding each depth map. The final difference map is compared for the left and right view respectively, according to the left and right steps and ground depth view and smoothed obstacle depth map (input depth map). The refined depth maps are applied in refinement network f to B.

Abstract

An occlusion-aware depth prediction (OADP) method uses adaptive convolutions to handle occlusions in monocular depth prediction. Our model models occluded regions by learning spatially adaptive convolution kernels within a deep neural network. Incorporates occlusion-aware loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract

Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in computer vision, enabling effective feature learning without manual annotations. This work proposes a self-supervised framework for learning joint RGB-D representations by exploiting the inherent consistency between RGB images and their corresponding depth maps. RGB and depth inputs are processed through separate encoders, and their resulting embeddings are jointly optimized using a contrastive loss. This approach encourages the model to learn semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent representations suitable for downstream tasks such as depth estimation and scene understanding.

Introduction

Self-supervised learning has gained significant traction across a wide range of computer vision applications, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive. Tasks such as image colorization, depth prediction, and view synthesis have demonstrated how intrinsic image properties can be leveraged as supervisory signals.

RGB-D data provides complementary visual and geometric information, making it an ideal candidate for self-supervised representation learning. By jointly learning from RGB appearance and depth structure, models can achieve more robust and transferable representations suitable for complex vision tasks.

Self-Supervised Learning for RGB-D Data

Self-supervised learning typically relies on pretext tasks that generate supervisory signals from the data itself. In the RGB-D setting, the relationship between color and depth offers a natural supervision mechanism. By constructing positive and negative pairs across modalities, the model learns to align RGB and depth representations in a shared embedding space.

The proposed method focuses on contrastive learning to capture meaningful correspondences between RGB and depth inputs, improving representation quality for tasks such as scene understanding and depth refinement.

Proposed Approach

3.1 Framework Overview

The proposed framework consists of two parallel encoders, one for RGB images and one for depth maps. Each encoder maps its input to a high-dimensional feature vector. These feature vectors are then projected into a joint embedding space where contrastive learning is applied.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture. RGB and depth images are passed through separate encoders, and the resulting embeddings are trained jointly using a contrastive loss to enforce alignment across modalities.

3.2 Joint Embedding Learning

Let x_r denote the RGB image and x_d denote the corresponding depth image. The encoders E_r and E_d produce embeddings:

f_r = E_r(x_r)
f_d = E_d(x_d)

These embeddings are projected into a shared space using projection heads P_r and P_d:

z_r = P_r(f_r)
z_d = P_d(f_d)

A contrastive loss encourages z_r and z_d from the same scene to be close while pushing apart embeddings from different scenes. This process results in a unified RGB-D representation that captures both appearance and geometric structure.

Experiments

The framework is evaluated on standard RGB-D datasets. Results demonstrate improved performance in downstream tasks such as depth estimation and semantic understanding compared to single-modality baselines, confirming the effectiveness of joint self-supervised RGB-D representation learning.

Conclusion

This work presents a self-supervised framework for learning joint RGB-D representations using contrastive learning. By leveraging the natural correspondence between color and depth, the method produces robust and transferable embeddings without requiring manual annotations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach and highlight its potential for future multimodal vision tasks.

Abstract

We propose a novel Multi-Scale Local Feature Aggregation (MS-LFA) method for image matching that improves scale robustness and enhances local matching accuracy. The proposed framework integrates multi-scale feature extraction with an efficient aggregation strategy to strengthen the discriminative power of local descriptors. MS-LFA effectively captures structural information across different spatial resolutions, leading to improved performance in challenging matching scenarios. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing image matching approaches.

1 Introduction

Image matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision with wide-ranging applications such as 3D reconstruction, object recognition, and visual localization. Accurate matching relies on robust local feature extraction, particularly under scale variations, viewpoint changes, and illumination differences.

Existing approaches often fail to fully exploit multi-scale information, leading to reduced discriminative capability. A key challenge is designing an aggregation mechanism that preserves informative patterns while maintaining robustness across varying resolutions.

The main contributions of this work are:

A novel Multi-Scale Local Feature Aggregation (MS-LFA) framework.

An improved aggregation strategy that enhances matching reliability.

Demonstration of superior performance on standard benchmark datasets.

2 Related Work
2.1 Multi-Scale Feature Extraction

Traditional methods such as SIFT and SURF extract scale-invariant features by analyzing images at different resolutions. More recent learning-based approaches adopt convolutional architectures for feature extraction but often rely on single-scale representations.

Feature aggregation techniques such as VLAD and NetVLAD have shown effectiveness in summarizing local descriptors. However, these methods typically lack explicit integration across scales, limiting their ability to capture hierarchical structural information.

3 Methodology

The proposed MS-LFA method consists of three main components:

Multi-scale feature extraction from input images.

Local descriptor aggregation using scale-aware weighting.

Matching score computation based on enhanced feature similarity.

3.1 Overview

For two input images, features are extracted at multiple resolutions and aggregated into a unified representation. The aggregation process emphasizes salient local structures across scales, improving matching accuracy.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall pipeline of the proposed MS-LFA framework, including keypoint detection, feature map generation, and aggregation mechanisms.

4 Experimental Results

MS-LFA was evaluated on standard image matching benchmarks. Results demonstrate improved precision and recall compared to traditional and deep learning-based aggregation methods. The method shows robustness under scale changes and complex scene variations.

5 Conclusion

We introduced MS-LFA, a multi-scale feature aggregation technique that improves local matching accuracy by capturing rich structural information across resolutions. The proposed approach enhances discriminative power and demonstrates consistent improvements over existing methods. Future work will focus on lightweight implementations for real-time applications.

Abstract

We propose a graph-based approach for dense monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The method integrates environmental image graphs and dense depth maps within a graph-optimization framework to handle scene non-linearities effectively. By enforcing structural regularities and photometric consistency, the system produces improved dense depth estimation and accurate camera trajectory recovery. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to existing monocular SLAM methods.

Introduction

Monocular SLAM enables simultaneous camera localization and environment reconstruction using a single camera. Traditional frame-based SLAM systems often suffer from scale ambiguity and sensitivity to non-linear scene dynamics. To address these limitations, we adopt a graph-based formulation that integrates dense depth maps and photometric consistency constraints to improve scene representation and pose estimation.

The proposed method constructs a pose graph where each node represents a keyframe and its associated depth map, while edges encode relative pose constraints. Optimization of this graph allows the system to handle non-linear motion and improve structural consistency, resulting in robust and reliable SLAM performance.

1 Methodology

We represent the SLAM system as a pose graph denoted by
G = (V, E)

where
V represents the set of keyframe nodes, each associated with a camera pose and depth map, and
E represents the set of edges encoding spatial constraints between nodes.

Each edge corresponds to a relative transformation constraint derived from photometric alignment between overlapping keyframes. The optimization process refines both camera poses and depth values simultaneously.

2 Energy Formulation

The total energy function is defined as:

E_total = E_photo + λE_graph

where:
E_photo enforces photometric consistency, and
E_graph enforces graph regularization constraints.

2.1 Photometric Consistency Term

The photometric error is defined as:

E_photo = Σ Σ ρ( I_ref(p) - I_curr(π(T D(p))) )

where:
I_ref and I_curr are reference and current keyframe intensity images,
T is the rigid transformation between frames,
D(p) is the depth value at pixel p,
π is the projection function, and
ρ is a robust Huber loss function.

2.2 Graph Regularization Term

The graph term is expressed as:

E_graph = Σ (T_ij - T̂_ij)^T Σ_ij^-1 (T_ij - T̂_ij)

where:
T_ij is the estimated transformation between nodes i and j,
T̂_ij is the measured relative pose, and
Σ_ij is the covariance matrix representing uncertainty.

System Overview

Figure 1 illustrates the proposed dense monocular SLAM pipeline, including the camera pose estimation module, dense depth computation, and pose graph optimization process.

Inputs:

Camera frames

Initial pose estimates

Outputs:

Refined camera trajectory

Optimized dense depth map

Results and Discussion

The proposed system demonstrates improved stability in dynamic environments and maintains consistent depth estimation under challenging illumination and motion conditions. The integration of photometric consistency with graph-based optimization significantly reduces drift and improves reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion

We introduced a graph-based dense monocular SLAM framework that integrates pose graph optimization and dense depth estimation for robust scene reconstruction and camera localization. The method effectively handles non-linearity and depth ambiguity through photometric consistency and structural constraints. Experimental evaluation confirms superior accuracy and robustness compared to baseline approaches.

Future work will explore real-time optimization and integration with semantic mapping components.

1 Introduction

Video action recognition is of significant importance in a variety of applications such as surveillance, sports analysis, and tempo-computer interaction. In illustration, current methods into observation requirements to integrate, in line with the recent development of deep learning.

Functional methods relating to hand-crafted features are limited. Instead, deep learning frameworks provide a rich representation related to joint spatial-temporal constraints and avoid hard task feature limitations.

Nonlinear functional information and simulations contribute. We evaluated that this field has more integrations or innovations emerging as tests and platforms evolve.

In this section, review presents works in modeling spatial mechanisms jointly for material methods that associate jointly to applications such as surveillance, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction.

The primary contributions focus on this present review, and structure, progressing on two-phase review segments.

2.1 3D Convolutional Networks

Dynamical CNNs venture into 3D CNNs to integrate spatial and temporal boundary mapping, capturing spatio-temporal features across video volume.

g(i,j,k) = ΣΣΣ w(a,b,c) x(i+a, j+b, k+c)

where Σ is sum, and (i,j,k) represent spatial and temporal coordinates of the input across volume.

Abstract

Unsupervised domain adaptation operation for semantic segmentation difficulties due to distribution shift between source and target domains. It proposes a novel approach combining adversarial learning with self training. A novel approach optimizes adversarial learning with self training. Large experimental validation validates the reliability on standard benchmarks. Further improvements include experimental results obtained, efficient training to supervised adversarial networks and results.

1 Introduction

Semantic segmentation is an important recognition problem in unsupervised segmentation. Although for scenarios, distribution shifts are common; distributions diverge from approaching adversarial learning. It aligns source and target distributions at the top of semantic segmentation maps to transform networks and wisdoms, preserve the adapting structure, extending representation (as proven accurate), in determining comparison scores.

2.1 Formulation

Defining source of domain adaptation approach defines an adversarial learning domain adjustment.

Dₐ = ((m4da)) and Dⱼ = (g) < D

The goal is to map an input image to a pixel-wise class prediction for both domains. The shared encoder E is used for segmentation source and target images as a discriminator D to distinguish feature maps provided by discriminator network D. The discriminator network D is applied to differentiate whether encoded representations are from the source or target domains. Under discrimination network, the discriminator aims to differentiate the encoded representations from the source and target domains.","

Abstract

Long-term visual localization in dynamic environments is affected by changing conditions and unchanged difficulties due to various factors related to local localization, and proposed broad approaches incorporate temporal iteration mechanisms in the convolutional neural network to robust visual tracking. We integrate temporal detection mechanisms in visual localization and high separation in localization, and present experimental results with comparisons demonstrating improvements over existing methods.

1 Introduction

Visual localization is a global challenge in dynamic environments. Recent advances utilize deep learning techniques. Other applications of visual localization methods properly provide formal and unsupervised adaptation of changing processes in visual localization models for remote environmental processing, providing deep networks including visual odometry, map-based localization, and pose localization. We also aggregate deep learning to manage in environments using deep localization methods to achieve effective visual environments.

2 Related Work

Visual localization methods investigate these mechanisms and introduce proposed innovations as an improved or generally improved method based on enhanced attention mechanisms such as visual odometry, structure from motion, map-based localization, and the use of deep learning for deep extraction and matching.

Introduction of visual localization in dynamic environments as recent methods explore for such challenges, network usage proposed in deploying navigation approaches, hierarchical localization pipelines, introduce CNNs because of mechanical types in constantly changing scenes with different measures. Additionally, many legitimate contributions to visual localization methods are original in highlighting environmental changes and processing stream constraints. These initial approaches focus on addressing dynamic environmental reservations.

Abstract

We propose a dense contrastive representation learning framework for monocular depth estimation. In contrast, we utilize a contrastive loss that penalizes similar regions of image to improve depth estimation accuracy. As a contrastive loss function, it intensifies the separation of region similarity and inter-region dissimilarity. In the experiments we integrate it into a depth estimation network, and results demonstrate performance gains in monocular depth estimation.

1 Introduction

Monocular depth estimation is essential in computer vision as well as normal applications such as interactions within augmented realities and 3D scene reconstruction. With recent advances in deep learning, obtaining high-precision accurate depth estimation remains challenging. To optimize content, we introduce learning of better contrastive representations for depth estimation, extracting enhanced dense similarity and discriminative sample pairs, in forms selecting inter-patch similarity and inter-patch dissimilarity to detail dissimilarity.

2.1 Monocular Depth Estimation

Existing methods for monocular depth estimation involve dense accumulation and visual reliability via feature extraction and multi-scale requirement aggregation, among supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to estimating depth without ground truth data. We explicitly follow this approach to learn dense contrastive representations.

In this paper, we contribute learning dense contrastive representations by comparing positive and negative samples to create competitive, forming positive pixel-wise representations through inter-patch similarity and inter-patch dissimilarity. Learn more.

2.2 Contrastive Representation Learning

Contrastive learning techniques compare dense contrastive representations, based on aggregation learning techniques as comparing positive and negative sample pairs. From contrastive productive coding (CPC) and Momentum Contrast (MoCo), learning yields representation learning, integrating into dense pixel-wise representation learning.

Abstract

Monocular 3D object detection from single images is a key task in autonomous driving and robot perception. However, the lack of explicit depth information poses significant challenges in accurately estimating object geometry and spatial positioning. This paper proposes a unified approach that integrates depth prediction, object localization, and object orientation estimation within a single framework. The model addresses these challenges by jointly optimizing depth estimation and object pose prediction, enabling robust 3D object detection from monocular input. Our method improves localization accuracy and satisfies the strict real-time requirements of modern autonomous systems.

1 Introduction

3D object detection from monocular images presents inherent difficulties due to the absence of direct depth cues. Accurate estimation of object scale, position, and orientation remains challenging. Recent literature explores combining depth estimation with object detection to improve spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose a unified model that tackles three tasks simultaneously: depth estimation, object localization, and 3D bounding box prediction.

2 Related Work

2.1 Monocular 3D Object Detection

Existing approaches typically rely on geometric constraints, pseudo-LiDAR methods, or monocular depth estimation techniques. These methods often separate depth prediction and object detection, leading to inconsistent performance. Recent advances attempt to combine these tasks but still suffer from limited robustness and generalization.

2.2 Depth Estimation

Monocular depth estimation techniques utilize convolutional neural networks to infer scene depth from image features. These predicted depth maps are then used to assist 3D object detection. Integrating depth estimation with detection improves spatial understanding, but challenges remain in maintaining consistency and accuracy.

Figure 1 shows an overview of our unified model for monocular 3D object detection.

3 Unified Model

3.1 Architecture

The proposed architecture consists of a shared backbone using a deep convolutional neural network, followed by three task-specific heads. These heads are responsible for depth estimation, 3D bounding box prediction, and object point localization. This unified structure allows feature sharing while enabling specialized processing for each task.

3.2 Loss Function

The total loss is a weighted combination of individual task losses, including depth prediction loss, object point loss, and bounding box regression loss. The overall objective function is defined as:

L = αL_depth + βL_box + γL_points

where α, β, and γ are weighting coefficients.

4 Experiments

4.1 Architecture Evaluation

The unified model is evaluated on standard benchmarks for monocular 3D object detection. Results demonstrate improved accuracy in both depth estimation and 3D localization compared to baseline methods. The combined loss formulation leads to more stable training and better generalization.

4.2 Performance Analysis

Experiments confirm that joint optimization of depth and detection tasks significantly enhances performance. The model achieves higher accuracy in 3D bounding box estimation and consistent improvements in object localization.",

Abstract

Video representation learning naturally incorporates learning to exploit common temporal structures in visual inputs. Improved representation learning seeks to overcome limitations of entropy representation to represent temporal coherence. The objective of unsupervised temporal coherence learning is to exploit temporal stability in videos and extract meaningful representations using temporal consistency as a pretext signal for video representation learning. This approach learns representations that preserve temporal structure and improves generalization capability. We evaluate the model in the area of video temporal coherence and demonstrate improved results compared with baseline methods, highlighting effectiveness in capturing temporal signals and reducing complexity while remaining robust and practical in applications.

1 Introduction

Video representation learning addresses the importance of representing temporal information in continuous sequences. It plays a crucial role in video understanding tasks, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of motion and temporal variation. Traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features and supervised learning, which are limited by annotation cost and generalization issues. The proposed method leverages unsupervised learning based on temporal coherence principles, enabling the model to learn stable feature representations across adjacent frames. This leads to significant improvements and robustness in video representation learning.

### Abstract

We present a deep learning based approach to visual odometry with uncertainty estimation, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model predicting camera motion from consecutive images while providing uncertainty estimates of the predictions. This approach combines pose estimation with a probabilistic view improved for uncertainty quantification, bridging deep learning and robotics. Experimental visualizations of real-world datasets demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.

### 1. Introduction

Visual odometry (VO) is a critical task in computer vision and robotics. Visual odometry focuses on improving accuracy of a vehicle’s trajectory using external sensors such as cameras. Recent learning-based visual odometry methods explicitly incorporate uncertainty associated with VO estimation, ensuring robustness and confidence estimation. In this paper, we highlight our contributions by considering calibrated error in collaborative predicted estimations in VO and translating quantitative requirements to a unified framework. We propose a core contribution to the paper, presenting improved reliability and precision. Our key principles are an explicit understanding of the proposed visual odometry to enable appraisal and demonstrate the paper’s contribution and implementation.

### 1. Introduction

Visual odometry (VO) is a crucial task in computer vision and robotics. VO demonstrates how a vehicle estimates motion relative to expected images to predict relative camera motion from sequential frames. This sequence is associated with conditional layers, providing conventional alignment as well as explicit uncertainty evaluation. A robust combination proposes refined contributions described through reductions of the form of treated uncertainty vectors and uncertainty estimation. This enables representing motion dynamics and uncertainty estimation in a consistent manner.

The CNN consists of convolutional layers, normalization, ReLU activations, and fully connected layers introducing 6 degrees of freedom G, and an uncertainty vector V, indicating uncertainty.

#### B. Uncertainty Estimation

The uncertainty estimation approach uses Gaussian distributions of pose parameters, where the confidence and translation uncertainties are represented using covariance matrices. The uncertainty vector parameterizes the Gaussian distribution, and the covariance matrix J is computed accordingly.

Cy = Chi denotes the pose variance, and the uncertainty vector B represents the predicted Gaussian distribution parameters.

### 3. Experiments

We present experimental results and evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in visual odometry accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract

We propose a Context-Aware Visual Relationship Detection (CAVRD) framework based on Transformer networks for robust detection and classification of visual relationships between object pairs. The method integrates contextual reasoning, spatial semantics, and attention-based feature encoding to improve relationship understanding in complex scenes. By leveraging multi-level contextual cues and global dependency modeling, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over existing baseline methods in both precision and recall. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced performance across standard visual relationship detection benchmarks.

---

1. Introduction

Visual relationship detection aims to identify interactions between objects, typically represented as subject–predicate–object triplets such as person riding bicycle. This task plays a critical role in image understanding, scene graph generation, and downstream applications such as image captioning and visual question answering.

Recently, transformer-based architectures have shown strong capability in modeling global context and long-range dependencies. However, many existing methods fail to fully exploit contextual information that influences relationships, such as surrounding objects, spatial configurations, and scene-level semantics. This work introduces a context-aware framework that enhances relationship detection by explicitly incorporating contextual reasoning through attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature integration.

Our main contributions are:

* A novel context-aware transformer architecture for visual relationship detection.
* Enhanced modeling of object interactions using global and local contextual cues.
* Improved performance on benchmark datasets compared to prior approaches.

---

2. Related Work

2.1 Visual Relationship Detection

Early approaches relied on pairwise appearance features and heuristic spatial modeling. Recent methods utilize deep neural networks to learn joint representations of subjects and objects, but often lack robust contextual reasoning. These limitations result in poor generalization for complex scenes.

2.2 Transformer Networks

Transformers have been widely adopted in natural language processing and increasingly in vision tasks. Their self-attention mechanism allows effective modeling of global dependencies and has proven beneficial for object detection and scene understanding. Our method extends these strengths to visual relationship detection by combining transformers with context-aware encoding.

---

3. Proposed Method

3.1 Context-Aware Transformer Architecture

The proposed CAVRD framework processes an input image through a convolutional backbone to extract feature maps. Region proposals are then generated and passed into a transformer encoder that models interactions between object regions. Contextual information is aggregated using attention layers, enabling the network to capture semantic relations influenced by surrounding objects and spatial layout.

The relationship prediction head takes encoded object pair features and produces predicate classifications.

Pipeline overview:

* Feature extraction using CNN backbone
* Object proposal generation
* Transformer-based contextual encoding
* Relationship classification

Figure 1 shows the overview of the proposed CAVRD framework. Given an input image, region proposals are processed by attention layers to generate contextual features and predict relationships between object pairs.

---

4. Experiments

Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted on benchmark datasets such as Visual Genome and VRD. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in relationship detection accuracy and contextual consistency.

Abstract

Dense pose estimation is a transformer-based approach to dense pose estimation. We present an approach based on transformers (ViTs) for single image dense pose prediction. This approach presents a context experience of self-attention to interpret body parts to enhance human poses. Compared with existing convolutional network-based methods, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with the DensePose-COCO dataset and demonstrates superior generalization on other benchmarks.

1 Introduction

Dense pose estimation is important in computer vision applications such as human-computer interaction, detailed realism as well as augmented reality and other imaging applications. A big approach is devised in vision transformers (ViTs). We enforce a uniquely integrated approach to implement improvements to dense pose estimation in this article.

We employ a transformer-based model to direct correspondences between surface points on the human body and a surface-based representation of human pose.

Introduction

Dense pose estimation can leverage a comprehensive advantage in coupling human-computer transformations, exposure reality for applications such as human-computer interaction and augmented reality. This work approaches an integrated formulation for effectiveness to read dense pose estimation. This implementation is convolutional method. It shows more main issues preceding and leads to constraints in early staging accessed on spatial information.

2 Method

Previous approaches use approaches including convolutional neural networks; however in complex practices a surface-based representation. Recently, we integrate the estimation transformer. It shows a rise gap during evaluation processing language dependences, but the method comes. However, transformer models suffer large processing inefficiency production costs due to multi-stage processing and a loss in spatial information.

Abstract

Deep representation learning for scene understanding remains a central problem in computer vision. Recent advances in deep representations such as highly discriminative, task-specific feature learning enable the extraction of rich hierarchical representations of visual scenes. Experiments are conducted on scene segmentation, object direction estimation, and scene classification. Results show that the proposed approach is effective and achieves improved performance compared to baseline models, reaching state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets.

1 Introduction

Scene understanding in computer vision involves interpreting the meaning of semantic content, recognizing and labeling objects, and classifying scenes for intelligent system applications. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, has significantly improved the effectiveness of learning representations and demonstrated strong experimental performance in scene understanding tasks. These learning methods have played a critical role in modeling the high-dimensional feature hierarchies of input images.

Scene understanding is crucial for computer vision, identifying semantic structures, interpreting spatial context, and enabling reliable classification across complex environments. Deep learning methods provide effective representations by capturing high-level contextual information and optimizing high-dimensional features for robust semantic interpretation and accurate classification.

The architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by pooling and activation layers, enabling the network to extract deeper and more robust features. This design supports improved gradient flow and enhances the learning of hierarchical feature representations.

Abstract

This novel approach presents visual representations via Augmented Semantic Clustering (ASC) to leverage a novel complementary data augmentation mechanism and semantic clustering for unsupervised learning of visual representations. ASC leverages unsupervised learning of visual representations, with precision prediction, augmentation, and diverse inductive bias from machine learning. In this paper we highlight selection preprocessing practices and optimally assessed performance on standard benchmarks. We outline this paper and review carefully.

1 Introduction

Unsupervised visual representation learning and clustering use tailored transformations to predict informative representations and semantic clustering. Expected behavior includes use of ASC, component-based sequencing, optimal convergence, and improved pretraining efficiency in the pipeline of mixture case augmentation models. In this presentation, we verify the experiments and discuss features.

2.1 Augmented Semantic Clustering

Consider a problem setting that takes advantage of precomputed clustering for optimal distribution of useful semantic assignments. This method crosses the following formulation:

2 Proposed Method
2.1 Augmented Semantic Clustering

The problem of unsupervised learning of cluster representations via semantic clustering is defined in Fig. 1 as follows:

L = Σ Σ y_ej log p_j , θ

where p_j,z,i are normalized random assignments and q are assignment probabilities.

Let augmented representations for normalized representations z₁ and z₂, using cosine similarity as g(z₁, z₂), be defined as:

P(zᵢ) = P(zᵢ)

where P(zᵢ) = normalized representations.

Secondly, the same objective function for Semantic Clustering provides:

D(zᵢ, Eᵢ) = cosine similarity
P(Gᵢ) = E_s a = normalized res(zᵢ + Eᵢ),

assignment probabilities.

where p_j is the assignment probabilities, ensuring that resulting q(i), a_i satisfy constraints for all i and Eᵢ constituting the normalization domain.","

Abstract

Object representations are critically important to representation learning frameworks for object recognition. We propose a consistency-based self-supervised representation learning approach that employs consistency constraints and realistic augmentation strategies. The resulting framework improves object representation learning by achieving better object recognition performance compared to existing self-supervised methods. In this work, we propose a model that encourages consistent object representations across different views and tasks.

1. Introduction

Object representations are vital to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, classification, and segmentation. In recent years, the availability of large unlabeled datasets has motivated the development of self-supervised methods that learn meaningful object-invariant representations by leveraging inherent structural properties of visual data.

Our proposed consistency-driven framework introduces two specific mechanisms by adding a consistency-based objective that aligns object representations across different views of the same object. This approach addresses limitations of existing models by improving robustness, invariance, and generalization through enhanced consistency constraints.

2. Proposed Framework

The proposed framework consists of an encoder f and a projection head g that map multiple input views into a shared object representation space. These representations are optimized using two objectives:

Contrastive objective

Abstract

In autonomous driving applications, maintaining vehicle safety and control while handling complex driving scenarios is critical. This paper formulates vehicle control as an optimization problem solved in real time using Model Predictive Control, MPC. The proposed framework develops a cost function that balances tracking performance with safety constraints such as collision avoidance and maintaining safe distances. A novel adaptive prediction model is introduced to account for environmental changes. The performance and robustness of the proposed MPC framework are demonstrated through both simulation and real-world experiments.

1. Introduction

Model Predictive Control, MPC, is a powerful control paradigm widely used in autonomous vehicle systems due to its ability to handle multi constraint optimization problems in real time. MPC uses a predictive model of vehicle dynamics to compute optimal control actions while satisfying operational and safety constraints in dynamic environments. This approach provides improved stability, safety, and responsiveness for autonomous driving tasks.

2. Methodology

The MPC framework is applied to autonomous driving for trajectory tracking and vehicle control.

Abstract

Motion blur in videos is often caused by camera movement or fast moving objects. Although visual techniques have been proposed for standalone deblurring under slight conditions, video enhancement remains challenging. This proposed approach employs temporal consistency constraints to enhance video quality. It prioritizes approaches that utilize temporal features and structure. Our approach in deep deblurring demonstrates improved results through enhanced video deblurring pipelines, achieving state of the art results in effective environments.

Introduction

Motion blur in videos is often caused by motion in scenes due to low light conditions. These conditions result in blurred frames and reduced reconstruction quality. Many blurring challenges arise in video frames. However, temporal alignment across video sequences provides improvements by utilizing information from adjacent frames, forming consistent estimates. A temporal deblurring approach generates promising results by improving degradation.

For identification and reference, our approach exploits consistent video alignment and leverages temporal consistency to enhance processing throughout frames, focusing on improving performance and effectiveness in providing a clear deblurred video.

1 Introduction

This section introduces the theoretical analysis of motion blur in videos and comprehensive methods for frame restoration. Deblurring techniques often face difficulties when applied to video, as blur varies across frames. Temporal consistency helps handle these variations and improve frame to frame accuracy. The framework focuses on enhancing variance and maintaining component coherence, achieving improved processing through layered deblurring modules.

2. Temporal Alignment

Alignment of blurred frames is performed to compensate for motion between frames. Estimation of motion information is applied to enhance frame consistency. The temporal alignment module is integrated in real time operation using estimation models.

To demonstrate this approach, the focus is on optimizing temporal consistency through alignment methods:

Bₒ(t) = φ(Bₜ, T)

where Bₒ(t) is the optical flow-based transformation T applied to the current frame Bₜ. Optical flow is used for frame warping and compensation during deblurring.

Abstract

Generative models are combined with semantic optimization to improve image synthesis by constructing generational images that align with desired semantic properties. Our method involves penalizing deviations from semantic targets C to align with desired semantic properties. In this draft, evaluated on multiple datasets, showing realistic images that are adequately producing appropriate output, but also reflecting unintended characteristics.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in deep learning have improved generative models, enabling the production of realistic images. As such, diverse research focuses on controlling semantic attributes in order to achieve desired goals and reduce regression from intended outcomes.

Generative GANs, e.g., StyleGAN and BigGAN, and VAE-based approaches such as MAE, have been used to generate high quality and diverse images. Prior work has shown that reducing image quality acceptance can be mitigated using techniques such as semantic embeddings and neural regularization.

Describes the proposed approach. The proposed approach constructs a generative model G that maps input noise vector z to image x. For optimization, the semantic constraints maximize semantic alignment with the target properties. The semantic space is estimated using a pre-trained image encoder F(·) with the target semantic representation S(x). The semantic loss function C calculates the distance between the generated semantic representation and the target.

We use the generated semantic representation and the target. In optimization, deployed by backpropagating gradients of J(x, y) through G, minimizing deviations from the target characteristics to minimize the new target.

Abstract

Vision language pretraining for large-scale visual understanding remains challenging due to object-level feature requirements. This approach presents a proposed visual pretraining setup for object-centric representation of vision-language inference tasks. Object-centric pretraining remains an important focus for robust representation and prompt-based learning objectives. In addition, our pretraining framework is focused on leveraging prompt performance. Experimental results show improved comparison performance and outcomes. Our data demonstrates superior performance using automatically annotated labels and reinforced object-centric pretraining approaches, delivering strong performance in low-shot and zero-shot learning settings for low-shot machine learning.

1 Introduction

Increasing recent significant progress in vision-language integrated systems has led to enhanced performance in tasks such as visual understanding and semantic grounding. Vision context-based processing is presented as an effective approach that seeks to establish the first contributions in this paper toward understanding vision-language inference. This paper discusses product-level vision-language integration and object-focused representation.

These approaches emphasize scalability and spatial alignment for semantic optimization. Proposed methods focus on spatio-transformative integration and annotation usage in multi-object learning.

Object-Centric Representations

Using the base image sample pair (x, y), where y is the object label, the representation is refined into a higher-level procedure as regression y(x) and masking y(x) across query prompts. This enables robust prompt generation and detection consistency for the oriented method.

3 Object-Centric Pretraining

The proposed pretraining method provides an image-pairing module that maps input regions into supervised object prompts. These prompts are processed through region-based supervision and attention-guided prompt orchestration. The approach emphasizes inter-object relational learning and representation consistency across integrated modalities.",

Video Object Segmentation


Abstract

Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is the task of presenting a particular moving target in videos. RVOS is challenging due to complex visual variants, heavy temporal drift, and inaccurate bounding. This work proposes the use of Cross-Attentional Transformers (CAT), inspired by the necessity of deep relational interpretation to measure object tracking. A two-stream framework is introduced, offering robust integration and refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CAT-based segmentation and significant improvements in accuracy.

1 Introduction

RVOS is the task of segmenting specific referenced targets within a video sequence based on text expressions. This task is challenging due to occlusion, viewpoint changes, varying scales, background clutter, and language ambiguity. Traditional approaches depend heavily on recurrent or optical-flow-based tracking methods. Additionally, most existing methods struggle with inconsistent temporal correspondence. CAT introduces a highly efficient solution using cross-attention to enhance relational comprehension and stabilize segmentation outcomes.

2 Method

2.1 Framework Overview

CAT consists of a video encoder, a language encoder, and a dynamic cross-attention integration and resampling unit. The video encoder extracts spatio-temporal features from input frames and constructs a dense feature representation. Given the natural language queries, CAT integrates them into the visual context to refine segmentation. The system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.3 Cross-Attention Module

The cross-attention module extracts semantic relations and spatial correspondence. The core formulation includes the combination of query, key, and value representations:

Q' = K'' + C'' + V'V'' (1)

Figure 2 achieves better performance.

CAT consists of a video encoder, a language encoder, and a cross-attention decoder. The method enables efficient mapping of semantic video and textual relations to produce refined segmentation maps. It processes sequential frames with integrated contextual attention mechanisms, enabling stable and accurate tracking of object boundaries throughout the video.

2.2 Cross-Attention Module

The cross-attention module is defined as follows:

Q = Q'' + K E K E V''

We measure the association using K'', and the corresponding outputs form the final segmentation result as shown in Figure 4.

Abstract

Semantic segmentation framework proposes a visual prompting framework for semantic segmentation. The segmentation is performed using a pre-trained vision model adapted using reusable prompting for many images. This process implements a framework for visual prompt interaction, aimed by application as a translation layer to the model. Visual prompting shows design patterns that result in improved performance, compared to the case of the baseline methods. A visual prompting framework is competitive efficiently.

Introduction

Semantic segmentation is processed to identify image pixels, labeling each pixel in an image according to that semantic assurance in current state open-ended tasks with later stable applied materials. Existing approaches train models and adopt transformers to leverage pre-trained vision encoders to new scales. Aligning visual prompting of our network makes it applicable to vital prior networks for segmentation workflows. These main contributions include:

• A visual prompting framework for semantic segmentation
• Prompt generation using transformers to process visual prompting
• Significant performance improvements across datasets

By main contributions

A specific decoder process through lightweight network for accessible segments.

Methodology

The visual prompting framework approaches the network that maps input through an encoder. Feature segments of reinforcement component are presented using Vision Transformer as a large base model that is optimized to manage workloads of pre-trained system models. This Vision Transformer is demonstrated in a deep pipeline and allows the segment organization by training a loss-discrete represent figure.

Abstract

A novel 3D object detection method leverages multi-view representations to detect objects within 3D scenes. In this paper, we present an approach that integrates multi-view comprehension into a convolutional neural network based framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves strong accuracy and stability, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on standard benchmarks.

1 Introduction

Accurate 3D object detection is critical for applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, challenges arise due to occlusions, varying object orientations, and complex backgrounds.

Multi-view representations are proposed as a key solution to enhance the proposed approach, which integrates complementary information from different viewpoints. The main contributions of this paper are:

Introduction of a 3D object detection pipeline utilizing multi-view representations.

A detailed experimental evaluation across various benchmarks with comprehensive results.

Discussion of related work and future directions in Section 4.

2 Methodology

2.1 Multi-View Representations

Multi-view representations are generated from multiple 2D images to detect object views of 3D scenes, including BEV, frontal, and side views. These views provide complementary spatial information and help reduce the impact of occlusion and background interference.

The 3D detection network is based on a CNN-driven architecture that shares multi-view feature maps. Features extracted by 2D CNNs are integrated and aligned spatially to enable accurate 3D bounding box regression and classification.

2 Methodology

2.1 Multi-View Representations

Representations are generated from multiple 2D images to integrate information from different viewpoints of a 3D scene, including BEV, frontal, and side views. These representations contribute feature maps to the 3D CNN for consistent extraction and spatial alignment.

Each representation computes features through convolutional layers, ensuring spatial consistency. The 3D object detection network integrates these features to perform:

• 3D bounding box regression
• Object classification

Abstract

We propose a bi-level approach to modeling fine-grained dialog actions in non-goal oriented dialog systems. Both coarse dialog acts and fine-grained actions are extracted from conversational dialogs. Important interpretative role plays between handlers of hierarchical response design arise in developing effectiveness.

1 Introduction

Identifying and modeling fine-grained dialog actions helps predict dialog response and user-specified dialog examples. It is important for building fact-oriented dialog systems constrained with fine-grained actions. In such extended dialogue models, we converge dialog coherence and programmatic switch state or semantic order of improving evaluation to user-agent interaction. Proposed a programmatic learning approach involving prediction-based approach to context.

Abstract

Introduction. A generative model for synthesizing image and depth images together. We propose a training model, a joint determination and a depth constraint also to measure shared geometric coherence which improves the model structure. It can generate realistic RGB image and depth image specific co-blending approaches. Deep model based on realistic tasks is generating the structural consistency in generative uncorrelated pairs and image and depth map comparisons.

1 Introduction

Depth information is a particularly salient and detectable constraint and correlation on high image representation models for scene identification and complete modeling. However, difficult depth synthesis was foundational and so synthesis using generative modeling in utilizing aspirative proposals that undertake joint image and depth synthesis. The proposed challenges in joint image and depth synthesis.

Abstract

Dynamic scene understanding with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) complements and advances research when analyzing temporal and spatial aspects of dynamic scenes. Our approach focuses on modeling a spatio-temporal graph, whereby sharing graph convolution operations for message passing and aggregation. This technique indicates object and addresses the weight performance in dynamic scene understanding, specific to obtain relationships in dynamic scene understanding research.

Abstract

Depth estimation learning from a single image is difficult to stabilize due to boundary occlusion. This study is formed on a method that is a classical choice focusing on measured importance of boundary awareness towards occlusion boundaries. A boundary-ordered loss computes on a new decision mechanism with occlusion masks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in depth predictions near occlusion boundaries, while maintaining high accuracy.

1. Introduction

In monocular depth estimation, estimating depth from a single image using CNNs presents challenges around occlusion boundaries. The paper treats combining occlusion information with exploration and incorporation of depth prediction.

2. Proposed Method

First, we aim at improving monocular depth prediction using a deep CNN trained to focus on occlusion boundaries in a monocular image.

2.1 Occlusion Boundary Detection

A deep CNN and a preprocessing pipeline is trained to provide enhanced results, using occlusion information from occlusion maps.

Abstract

We seek to learn robust visual representations in progressive contrastive language-image pretraining. We utilize supplementary additional information such as detailed textual descriptions of images during pretraining. In this work, we estimate a distinct FGLIP framework to dynamically integrate information from both global and local features during representation learning. To maintain continuity, we develop our proposed contrastive objective and a hierarchical attention mechanism to design our implementation of the image encoder FGLIP, which demonstrates enhanced performance in image classification, cross-modal retrieval, and object detection.

1. Introduction

In computer vision, factors related to the intrinsic complexity and diversity of natural images require constructing fine-tuned improvements in many desired tasks, especially in available cross-modal software methods adding contrastive language-image training methods such as CLIP, under lower qualitative receptive textual features, to optimize feature quality.

Constructively, FGLIP dynamically integrates both global and local descriptors for representation learning, subject to implementing a region-level contrastive objective as well as its integrated hierarchical attention mechanisms. In this work, we explain contributions of FGLIP include:

2. Related Work

In increasing intentions regarding virtue on high-quality visual representations and essentially awareness among visual-specific area features, e.g., multi-stream hierarchical level representations, many works emphasize drifting steps to enhance both environments and performance.

Key contributions:

1. Explore broad experimental investigation for why central image formal representations in its finest productive settings have been required on individual inputs with statistical stability.
2. Key results: improve reliability and improvement in downstream tasks, such as image classification, retrieval, and detection.

ABSTRACT

Recent advances in pose-guided image generation have significantly improved the ability to synthesize realistic human images under specified pose constraints. These methods aim to generate images conditioned on a target pose while preserving the identity and appearance of the source subject. However, maintaining structural consistency and visual fidelity across complex pose transformations remains challenging.

This paper proposes a deep learning based framework for pose-guided image generation that integrates pose-conditioned feature alignment with adversarial learning. Our approach focuses on extracting spatial pose representations and guiding the generation process through multi-stage refinement. The proposed method demonstrates improved realism, structural coherence, and identity preservation compared to existing models. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves superior qualitative and quantitative performance on standard benchmarks.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized image generation, particularly in conditional synthesis tasks. Pose-guided image generation seeks to transfer a person’s appearance from a reference image to a new target pose. This task is crucial for applications such as animation, virtual try-on systems, and human motion synthesis.

Traditional methods often rely on predefined templates or handcrafted constraints, which limit their flexibility and generalization. While some conditional models show promising results, they struggle with maintaining fine-grained details and coherent body structure during drastic pose changes. Our work addresses these issues by introducing a pose-aware generation strategy that explicitly incorporates spatial pose information into the learning process.

II. RELATED WORK

A. Pose-Guided Image Generation

Existing approaches to pose-guided generation commonly employ encoder-decoder architectures and conditional generative adversarial networks. These models use pose heatmaps to guide the synthesis process but frequently suffer from misalignment artifacts and blurred textures. Recent research has explored attention mechanisms and feature warping techniques to improve spatial correspondence, yet challenges remain in handling occlusions and complex deformations.

III. PROPOSED METHOD

A. Pose-Embedded Generation Framework

We introduce a pose-embedded generation model that conditions both the encoder and decoder on explicit pose representations. The network learns to map a source image and a target pose into a realistic synthesized image by aligning semantic features with pose-aware constraints.

B. Adversarial Learning Strategy

Our framework employs adversarial training to enhance image realism. A discriminator network evaluates the authenticity of generated images while enforcing consistency with the target pose. This encourages the generator to produce visually coherent outputs that align with the specified pose.

C. Adversarial Optimization

We integrate additional loss functions such as perceptual loss and feature consistency loss to stabilize training and preserve fine details. This results in smoother transitions and more accurate pose transformations, even under challenging conditions.

IV. EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate our method on standard human pose datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art pose-guided generation approaches. Results demonstrate that our model produces sharper images, better pose alignment, and improved identity retention.

V. CONCLUSION

This paper presents an effective pose-guided image generation framework that leverages pose embeddings and adversarial learning. The proposed method achieves strong performance in generating realistic human images under diverse pose conditions, offering promising potential for applications in animation and virtual content creation.

**Abstract**

Object localization in computer vision is a core task. This paper proposes a novel model based on deep convolutional neural networks, integrating localization and classification through a single end-to-end model generating high-resolution feature maps with added attention mechanisms for fine-scale efficiency and robustness. Results show improved performance on benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

**Introduction**

Object localization is an important part of many real-world applications. Such problems, in particular, involve many complexities of image variation. This paper focuses on recent advances in deep learning. A key challenge in deep learning is handling cases where localization and classification are learned jointly in complex scenes.

**Localization Framework**

Identification of important architectural localization constitutes an encoder-decoder structure to better model deep localization maps. The decoder produces refined localization maps. The attention module is integrated to enhance resolution through a novel design for combination-based mechanisms for joint learning.

**Training Details**

To train this model, we consider improvements in the training process, comprising localization and classification components balanced by a hyperparameter. Optimization is done using SGD with momentum, and the learning rate is decayed throughout training.

**Abstract**

Introduction. Zero-shot semantic segmentation models aim to understand semantic classes across domains and scene semantics. This proposal develops an improvement in this area by considering a hybrid approach that leverages side information and multi-operational heuristics, building a Domain Adaptive Segmentation Network where cross-domain consistency seeks alignment between visual scenes and semantic priors. Experimental results demonstrate segmentation performance improvements across various domains and provide potential class distributions.

**Introduction**

Zero-shot semantic segmentation is utilized to enable semantic segmentation without explicit annotations for each domain. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges remain due to domain shifts and semantic variations. Data constraints include pretrained CNN-based solutions and correlative cues embedding semantic information, e.g. multi-embeddings, to guide segmentation. However, these methods often struggle to develop a truly robust framework.

In prospective zero-shot semantic segmentation, zero-shot approaches demonstrate reduced performance across novel domains. While types show improved performance, proposed methods vary in quality characteristics to handle diverse and scarce data distributions. Incrementally, the task remains challenging when combining weak supervision with improved results and stronger latent supervision.

**2 Framework**

**2.1 Enhancement**

The proposed framework consists of a common representation, separate class-imbalance domains, and dynamically consistent mid-level semantic models such as word-pairs and backbone representations.

Figure 1. Overview of our DASN+SAM zero-shot semantic segmentation approach.

**2. DASN**

A DASN+SAM is a segmentation network with an SAM-based encoder via a CNN-based backbone. The input image is processed and aligned to encourage consistent outputs across larger domains. Our empirical studies validate the approach by forcing alignment across process layers, level embeddings into the visual feature spaces using multi-level for robust semantics.

**4 Method**

The DS-CV framework consists of a DASN and an indirect approach. We use a segmentation network processed by a normalized CNN-based extraction. The input image is supervised from a source domain to encourage consistent outputs across target domains.

**3 Training Objective**

The proposed framework eventually trains using fine annotations and pixel-level embeddings. A segmentation loss and scale-matching loss ensure consistent alignment between domain-based embeddings and feature representations.

Abstract

Learning visual representations is a fundamental task in computer vision. An important point as the approach optimizes the representational anchors, although this maximization facilitates end-to-end representations with a controlled, activity-templating CNN. Extensive experimental investigations demonstrate our effectiveness in the model of learning and effectiveness of data-to-task technique opportunities.

1. Introduction

Learning high-quality visual representations is a fundamental task in computer vision. Deep learning techniques offer automation over manual feature engineering. These keep learning-based approaches enabling visual perception on large-scale datasets. This includes convolutional neural networks that effectively target training approaches, but these methods combine a controlled systematic representation at input, which allows us to automatically optimize representations from raw images without feature engineering.

Experiments

We evaluate our proposed method on image classification benchmarks. The network is initialized and input into an image classification pipeline. The results report improvements in classification accuracy compared to other methods. In computational alternatives, we continued our method to our supervised baselines. We optimize our method so that effective visual representations on-stage computation is achieved.

Figure 1. Overview of our end-to-end learning framework.

A sample model in a CNN consists of convolutions, batch normalization, and ReLU activations to map visual inputs to visual representations. These representations support optimization frameworks that provide a solution of context-image-level classification on interaction.

Experiments

Evaluating our proposed method on image classification benchmarks, we test our network using the end-to-end approach to report representations in classification, again compared to other methods. Improvements in classification demonstrate state-of-the-art by other methods. Learning emphasizes visual learning effective visual representations in an end-to-end manner.

**Abstract**

A three-structured approach for multi-scale attention mechanisms for semantic segmentation in unified scenes. We implement a token-encoded, designed proposed approach in the diverse scales of objects as an input and complex background. A proposed novel attention module uses multi-scale feature representations to capture contextual information at different levels of detail. Our method integrates into a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture. It highly enhances segmentation performance in well-known datasets, such as Cityscapes and ADE30K.

**1 Introduction**

Semantic segmentation is an important task such as autonomous driving and scene understanding, as well as classifying each pixel in an image, accurately classifying each pixel in an image. While this paper still aligns systems of traditional CNNs with encoder-decoder architectures required to capture deeper scale and ""clean"" max pooling mechanisms to align area correspondences.

Abstract

We present a robust approach for scene text recognition. A major challenge in text recognition lies in handling complex real-world distortions, including curved text, varying illumination, and irregular background patterns. Our method integrates a transformation module for text normalization, feature extraction for robust representation, and a sequence modeling module for comprehensive contextual dependencies. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks.

1 Introduction

Scene text recognition requires managing substantial variations in appearance caused by complex conditions such as distortions, background clutter, and inconsistent illumination. Traditional approaches struggle with these challenges due to limited adaptability. To address this, we propose a unified framework incorporating transformation modeling, feature extraction, and sequence modeling to improve robustness and recognition accuracy.

2 Framework Overview

Figure 1. Overview of our scene text recognition framework

The framework consists of three main components:

Pre-processing and normalization

Feature extraction module

Transformation and sequence modeling modules

2.1 Feature Extraction Module

The feature extraction module is responsible for generating discriminative representations from input images. It employs convolutional layers to extract spatial features necessary for accurate recognition.

Figure 2. Architecture of the feature extraction module

Input image → Convolutional layers → Extracted feature map

2.2 Transformation Module

The transformation module adapts feature representations to handle geometric distortions. A spatial transformer network is used to normalize text appearance, ensuring consistent alignment and improved readability.

Spatial transformations include:

Affine normalization

Perspective correction

Text displacement adjustment

This module enables the system to manage curved and skewed text effectively.

2.3 Pre-processing

Pre-processing standardizes input images by correcting geometric distortions and enhancing visual clarity. Techniques include:

Contrast normalization

Image resizing

Noise reduction

These steps improve the stability of subsequent recognition stages.

2.4 Sequence Modeling

A sequence modeling module captures contextual dependencies between characters. By analyzing character sequences holistically, the system improves recognition of ambiguous or visually degraded text.

3 Experimental Results

The proposed method demonstrates significant performance gains over baseline models across multiple scene text recognition benchmarks. The integration of spatial transformation and contextual modeling yields high accuracy even under challenging conditions.

Abstract
Object-centric learning for scene understanding includes transfer translation in transport structured representations. Resulting predictions to segment scenes into individual objects without operator-visible data from learning yielding object-centric representations, robust simplified evaluation, resolution and domain utilities, set performances on synthetic and real-world datasets. Strong rigorous experiments necessitate aggregation to object-centric representational precision for refined object tracking and relational reasoning. Summary: Overview of the proposed object-centric learning model. The model uses an implicit scene as input and segments it into the latent positions while learning unique object-centric representations.

1. Introduction

Comprehensive scenes depend on complex signal and important roles; it is important for computer vision in ecosystems. Today’s vivid innovations in computer vision environments present fine-grained partitioning of complex scenes. Most limitations in designing object-centric models face scene decomposition and object-level reasoning.

Comprehension is comprehensive scene understanding in relation, that each object has intrinsic properties. A proposition requires segmentation in important operations for achieving fine-grained parsing.

3. Object-Centric Representation

Object-centric representation defines a scene into objects such that each object’s intrinsic properties as well as relations are created sequentially; it enables generalization.

Abstract

Advances in monocular depth estimation have achieved newly valuable improvements based on real-world conditions. We augmentations allow robust single usage. We extract robust signals and spatial cues, then learn geometry from a single image. Improved models leverage transformer-based prediction to strengthen context mechanisms for improved implementation, simulating robustness for complex self-refining networks. In addition, adaptation strategies produce more stable depth estimation, permitting consistency in various scene representations. In recent applications in artificial vision, and real-world representations.

Introduction

Introduction. Monocular depth estimation from a single image, though challenging, demonstrates strong union of contextual local properties with convolutionally smooth processing. In many instances, a modern approach to deriving the practical depth understanding found in the observed environment focuses on visual and gradient sensitivity analysis addressing day and low-light variation. The framework aims to smooth estimates and reduce inconsistencies in complex-rendered modalities. We assume that robust smoothing enables easier generation, not only across general scenes. The model incorporates neural ramification for more accurate hierarchical reasoning, guided through spatial recognition.

Use of transformer-based approaches provides significant improvement in visual translation for rapid environment segmentation guidance. However, constraints in generalization remain due to limitations of the near field and environmental variability. Deep prior context and alignment mechanisms are incorporated to enhance model stability and integration of intermediate representations and multi-scale feature refinement. Our contributions present a robust architecture for depth estimation and transformer-based reasoning, while maintaining consistency and compatibility in domain handling.

Properties

Transformer-based approach proposes transformer-based vision architectures that leverage the ViT model and combine the usage of global representation and effectiveness on range depth estimation.

**Abstract**

This proposed cross-descriptor representation learning method integrates information from different visual descriptors to enhance feature learning. In this perspective, we use distinct subnetworks for joint encoding of cross-descriptors and align the encoded features in a learning cumulative approach. As evidenced, experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show the cross-descriptor enhancing contrastive imitation for richer downstream tasks compared to individual descriptors.

---

### 2. Introduction

Visual representation learning is critical and important in a broad range of multimedia vision applications. Deep interpretations integrate representations from diverse base descriptors, such as SIFT, HOG, or deep learning embeddings. Prior methods treat descriptors under single-based approaches to learning a shared visual representation across proposed descriptors.

---

### Related Work

Previous descriptor-based representation learning methods include traditional handcrafted descriptors, SIFT, HOG, and deep-learning-based descriptors. Recent deep-learning-based approaches focus on building expressive subspace representations for all-spectrum classification and contrastive learning.

---

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1 Descriptor Encoders

We define input images per image ( I ), and each descriptor vector ( D \in \mathbb{R}^d ), i.e., ( D = \text{design of subnetwork } s_i ) parameterized by ( G_i ), that encodes each intermediate representation ( a_i = \mathbb{R}^m ).

#### 3.2 Contrastive Alignment

We use the encoded representations ( Z = (z^1, ..., z^k) ) and formulate a contrastive loss ( \ell ) over positive and negative pairs of representations. After sufficient training, the shared representation vector of an image is represented by ( f(I) ) as the concatenation of ( Z ), and is used as the resulting frozen encoder for downstream tasks.

Abstract

This paper investigates leveraging multimodal data for 3D object detection in complex scenes. The proposed approach utilizes a neural network framework that combines RGB images and LiDAR data through an attention based fusion mechanism for robust mobile detection. The method integrates sensor data using a convolution based network to enhance detection accuracy and resilience by extracting complementary features from different sensors. Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state of the art results.

1. Introduction

3D object detection plays a critical role in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception. Modern detectors benefit from combining different modalities, particularly RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors, to improve detection reliability and robustness. Multimodal approaches allow the system to exploit both semantic and geometric information, leading to improved performance under challenging conditions.

2. Related Work

2D object detection methods are commonly categorized into region based and single stage detectors. Convolutional neural networks have been widely used to generate bounding boxes from image data. However, these methods often struggle with depth understanding. Recent multimodal approaches integrate LiDAR point clouds with image data to enhance spatial awareness and bounding box precision.

3. Multimodal Fusion Network

This section describes the architecture of the proposed neural network for multimodal 3D object detection. The framework is illustrated in Figure 1.

3.1 Feature Extraction

The RGB stream uses a convolutional neural network to extract image features, producing semantic feature maps. The LiDAR stream encodes point cloud data into a voxel grid representation and employs a 3D CNN to extract spatial features.

Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to or exceeding existing approaches.

4. Fusion Module

The fusion module integrates RGB and LiDAR features using an attention mechanism that dynamically weighs contributions from each modality. This allows the network to emphasize reliable sensor data depending on scene conditions.

Figure 1. Overview of the proposed 3D object detection framework showing RGB input, LiDAR input, and fusion module.

5. Experimental Results

The system was evaluated on the KITTI dataset and demonstrated significant improvements in detection accuracy and localization precision. The results validate the effectiveness of combining complementary visual and depth information through multimodal fusion.

6. Conclusion

This work presents a multimodal fusion framework for 3D object detection that integrates RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using an attention based neural network. The proposed system achieves improved robustness and accuracy, showing strong potential for real world autonomous applications.

Abstract

Deep attention mechanisms are employed for fine-grained image recognition tasks to deliver strong, alleviated recognition performance. We utilized simplifying approaches further to distill convolutional strategies and provide the existing baseline comparison analysis to optimize high confidence in common fine-grained image recognition. With accumulated structure across the base image, these attention mechanisms enabled reinstated performance by refining pixel annotated image segments and attributes to estimate image attention. A neural based system is set to support performance compared by handling methods. Therefore, strategies which integrate the “learned by machine” methodology. Experimentally, in design and classification vision integration, representations offer better selection to fine properties among fine-grained image recognition tasks, and aim to include features from processing visual patterns.

1. Introduction

Fine-grained image recognition is a key component in computational computer vision, especially in unresolved visual advances. It aims to recognize and distinguish fine differences among instances that belong to similar object categories. These challenges arise in scenarios requiring high resolution discrimination among highly similar objects.

Related Work

Early works using hand crafted feature variations are partly complemented with recent CNN based approaches. Second generation CNN based approaches include detection framework variants, attention mechanisms utilizing gradient visualization, and multi-stage attention networks.

3.2 Spatial Attention Modules

Attention mechanisms generate spatial modules, enabling the construction of attention weights from intermediate feature maps by an effective image.

3.3 Integration with CNNs

We integrate attention modules on a standard CNN architecture which can then be trained end to end.

Abstract

An innovative deep learning based approach for human pose estimation from monocular images is presented. We propose a novel convolutional neural network model designed to improve joint localization accuracy by modeling spatial relationships and leveraging end to end training for robust performance. Our use of dense supervision and adaptive constraints enables enhanced estimation results, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency in challenging scenarios.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human pose estimation aims to use cameras to infer the positions of body joints in a single image. This problem is challenging due to occlusion, background clutter, and variations in appearance and lighting. Many methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including convolutional neural networks and graphical models. However, precise joint estimation remains difficult in complex environments. Recent advances in deep learning provide opportunities for improved accuracy through better feature extraction and spatial modeling.

11 RELATED WORK

Pose estimation has been studied extensively in computer vision. Earlier methods relied on handcrafted features and geometric constraints. More recent approaches leverage deep convolutional networks to directly regress joint positions or heatmaps. Several works have focused on combining spatial context and multi scale features to boost performance. Despite these advances, achieving reliable estimation in real time remains an open challenge.

111 METHODOLOGY

The proposed model employs a deep convolutional architecture to learn joint representations from monocular images. The network consists of stacked convolutional layers followed by regression modules that predict joint heatmaps. Training is performed using supervised learning with annotated pose data. The model incorporates spatial constraints to enforce anatomical consistency and improve robustness.

Abstract

We propose a deep learning based approach for distinguishing reflections and transmissions in images. The method analyzes visual appearances caused by reflective surfaces and transmitted layers using a convolutional neural network architecture. Our model is trained with synthetically generated data and real world samples to identify strong reflections while preserving underlying scene information. Experimental results demonstrate robust performance in challenging conditions, including complex lighting and heavy reflective artifacts. The proposed technique outperforms traditional reflection separation methods and provides accurate detection for practical applications.

1 Introduction

Distinguishing between reflections and transmissions is a difficult task in computer vision, especially in images captured through glass or transparent surfaces. In such scenarios, multiple visual layers are mixed, leading to ambiguous interpretations. Traditional approaches rely on physical modeling and handcrafted features, but these methods struggle with variations in lighting and scene complexity. Recent advances in deep learning provide more effective solutions by learning discriminative features directly from data.

2 Related Work

Prior research on reflection and transmission detection has focused on reflection separation and layer decomposition. Early methods used heuristic rules and edge based features, while more recent work incorporates convolutional neural networks to enhance separation quality. These approaches show improvements but often fail in cases with strong reflections or complex backgrounds. Our work builds upon CNN based techniques and introduces a more robust framework for reliable detection.

3 Method

3.1 Network Architecture

The proposed model consists of two main components: a convolutional feature extractor and a classification module. The CNN extracts hierarchical features from the input image and feeds them into parallel branches that predict reflection and transmission maps. This design allows the network to learn both global context and fine local details. The outputs represent probability maps indicating the presence of reflections and transmitted content.

Figure 1. Example input images, reflection regions, and transmission outputs predicted by the proposed method.

Figure 2. Block diagram of the proposed network architecture.

3.2 Training Strategy

The network is trained using a combination of synthetic and real images with annotated reflection and transmission layers. Data augmentation is applied to increase robustness against lighting changes and noise. A loss function combining reconstruction loss and classification loss ensures accurate separation and stable convergence.

4 Results and Discussion

Our method achieves superior results compared to baseline techniques on benchmark datasets. It effectively detects strong reflections while preserving the integrity of the transmitted scene. The model shows consistent performance in indoor and outdoor environments with varying illumination conditions.

ba","Deep Context-Aware Object Detection

Abstract

Inferring contextual information is essential in computer vision. We introduce a deep learning based approach for context aware object detection. The framework integrates semantic aggregation of contextual regions and enhances feature maps using spatial attention. Our method evaluates surrounding areas to improve detection accuracy while remaining robust to occlusion and clutter. Through collaborative context computation, we address inconsistency and local ambiguity in object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved performance on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO) and highlight the effectiveness of context enriched neural networks.

1 Introduction

Inferring environmental context is crucial in computer vision tasks such as scene understanding and object detection. Contextual cues play an important role in recognizing objects when appearance alone is ambiguous. Environments often contain objects whose identities depend heavily on surrounding semantic information. While modern detectors excel at localizing objects, challenges remain in reasoning robustly about context dependent scenes.

We propose a context aware detection strategy designed to incorporate contextual cues into the detection pipeline. The method aggregates spatial information from surrounding regions and merges it with object level representations. This enables the model to address difficult detection cases and improve recognition in visually complex scenarios.

2 Related Work

Contextual reasoning has been explored in a variety of forms, including scene level priors, semantic segmentation assisted detection, and attention based networks. Prior methods incorporate spatial relationships between objects to enhance classification robustness. However, many approaches rely heavily on pre computed context or fail to generalize to diverse scenes. Our approach builds upon convolutional neural networks and integrates context features through learned attention mechanisms.

3 Approach
3.1 Context Enriched Convolutional Network

The proposed module enriches object level features with contextual signals. It aggregates spatial relations around proposed regions and refines feature maps using learned weighting functions. This produces context-aware representations that enhance detection strength in ambiguous settings.

The contextual module processes input feature maps and outputs refined representations optimized for downstream detection tasks.

4 Experiments

Experiments were conducted on widely used benchmarks such as MS COCO. Results show consistent improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) over baseline CNN detectors. Context enriched models demonstrate robustness to cluttered backgrounds and small or partially occluded objects.

Qualitative results indicate better localization stability, with cleaner bounding boxes and fewer false positives. Quantitative metrics reflect significant gains across multiple object categories.

Graph Decomposition

Abstract

We present a deep learning model for scene parsing with a joint graph decomposition approach. The method performs region level parsing with a probabilistic framework over hierarchical scene representations, providing structured reasoning between regions and pixel level predictions. The system integrates graph based partitioning and a unified training objective to obtain consistent segmentation. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate improved accuracy on PASCAL-context and related datasets, showing notable gains over baseline methods.

1 Introduction

Scene parsing is a central problem in semantic segmentation and understanding complex environments. The goal is to assign semantic labels to every pixel while maintaining coherent structure across regions. Traditional methods rely heavily on handcrafted features and predefined rules, making them sensitive to noise and scene variability.

Recent deep learning approaches have improved segmentation accuracy, but often lack explicit modeling of region relationships. Scene structure is inherently hierarchical. Integrating region level reasoning with deep convolutional features can improve robustness, especially in scenes containing overlapping objects, clutter, and fine grained boundaries. Our work addresses these issues through a hybrid deep neural and graph decomposition framework.

2 Related Work

Scene parsing has been explored through convolutional networks, probabilistic graphical models, and joint segmentation–classification pipelines. Fully convolutional networks have demonstrated strong performance, but often treat pixels independently. Region based graphical models improve structure but are computationally expensive. Recent hybrid methods attempt to combine pixel level CNN features with graph reasoning for improved consistency.

Overview of our method. Given an input image, our model produces an initial segmentation map. Region proposals and graph decomposition are then applied, and both components contribute to the final prediction.

4 Proposed Method

Our deep learning model combines a multistage CNN feature extractor with a graph decomposition module. The CNN produces dense feature maps, which are then refined through a region aggregation layer. Graph based optimization enforces region consistency and boundary alignment.

The model jointly learns region grouping and pixel classification. A graph guided refinement stage improves segment coherence by propagating information across related regions.

Abstract

The paper explores how deep learning can be used for semantic segmentation, analyzing improvements in segmentation accuracy using convolutional neural network based architectures, primarily Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). The work reviews recent advancements, discusses methods for pixel wise supervision, and examines model optimization techniques. Experiments show increased segmentation performance and highlight baseline improvements.

I. INTRODUCTION

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task concerned with assigning dense semantic labels to an image, covering all regions consistently. It is a fundamental dimension in scene understanding. To enable segmentation on diverse scenes, improvements in convolutional models have advanced robustness through pixel level prediction, region based refinement, and context modeling.

Recent deep learning methods allow automated feature extraction, reducing the need for manual engineered features. Yet challenges remain in maintaining spatial consistency and capturing long range contextual information.

II. RELATED WORK

Convolution based segmentation approaches include early fully convolutional networks, improved normalization techniques, and optimization frameworks. Additional methods incorporate conditional random fields, dilated convolutions, and multi scale feature aggregation. These approaches extend traditional segmentation by enhancing context propagation and improving boundary localization.

III. METHOD
A. Fully Convolutional Network

The primary model follows an encoder–decoder design, using convolutional layers to extract deep representations from the input image. The network replaces fully connected layers with convolutional layers, enabling dense predictions. Skip connections and upsampling layers restore spatial resolution, producing pixel level segmentation maps.

IV. LOSS

A supervised loss function is used for training segmentation networks. Cross entropy loss is commonly applied to pixel wise classification. Additional regularization terms can help maintain spatial coherence and reduce over smoothing.

Abstract

Recent introductions in deep learning for object detection and segmentation demonstrate improved performance in both accuracy and robustness. Incorporating innovative deep architectures enables the detection of miniature objects, improved localization, and refined segmentation for frame level prediction and region generation. A practical system explores the selective combination of feature extraction and attention to enhance detection performance. We propose a multi architecture design that is efficient and scalable while maintaining consistency across tasks. Experimental results show improved object detection and segmentation performance over existing baselines.

1 Introduction

Object detection and segmentation are essential in fields involving high precision interpretation and visual understanding. Frameworks such as Faster R CNN, YOLO, and Mask R CNN demonstrate strong capabilities on datasets such as COCO and PASCAL VOC, offering end to end learning with accurate bounding box regression and pixel level segmentation. The contributions of this paper include architectural variations and improved components for stronger detection and segmentation accuracy.

2 Novel Deep Learning Architecture

We introduce an integrated object detection and segmentation architecture designed to remain stable across multi stage workflows with two primary components illustrated in Figure 2.

2.1 Backbone Network

The proposed architecture includes a backbone specially designed to support deep convolutional activation and feature extraction. It incorporates structured convolutional blocks and attention mechanisms. The backbone processes input images and outputs deep feature maps for prediction.

2.2 Multi Task Prediction Head

The multi task prediction head connects to the backbone for object detection and segmentation. It includes classification scores, bounding box regression, and segmentation mask generation. We jointly train these structured feature representations.

Figure 1

Visualization of our proposed object detection architecture.

Figure 2

3 Experimental Results
3.1 Datasets

Experiments were conducted using standard datasets, including COCO and PASCAL VOC, to evaluate model consistency.

3.2 Performance

Computational evaluation shows the proposed model performs significantly better than earlier approaches. Improved detection accuracy is observed in Figure 1. Additional findings highlight robustness across variations in object scale and segmentation quality.

A complete analysis demonstrates stability under diverse visual settings, reinforcing the model’s applicability in future detection and segmentation research.

4 Conclusion

We demonstrate improvements in convolutional architectures for object detection and segmentation. The proposed system enhances localization accuracy and segmentation consistency. Further integration of spatial reasoning and multi level feature extraction could yield additional performance gains. Fine grained analysis suggests the model provides strong results for object level tasks and supports continued advances in deep learning based detection.

Abstract

This paper proposes a neural network based method for image segmentation. By combining an image into meaningful segments using convolutional neural networks, we partition a model–decoder architecture with skip connections. In this approach, we use an encoder–decoder network to capture information across multiple scales, and we learn the relevant features using experimental techniques. Other performance results specify baseline improved experimental use.

1 Introduction

Image segmentation is important in computer vision applications. It is used in object detection, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. Deeper methods can be considered by introducing challenges such as deep learning classifiers. While deep learning approaches involve encoder–decoder connections to localize, we introduce a neural network–based approach containing an encoder–decoder architecture with skip connections.

Due to many factors, deep representation techniques such as those used in complex image analysis mitigate drawbacks of classical methods.

Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial feature learning framework designed to improve the robustness and performance of object detection models. Our method employs a dual stream architecture in which one stream focuses on feature extraction while the other employs a dedicated adversarial network for generating perturbations against the detector. Through adversarial feature learning, the model is encouraged to distinguish robust features from adversarial variations, enhancing the generalization capability in challenging environments. Extensive experiments on the COCO, PASCAL VOC, and Open Images datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state of the art methods in terms of both robustness and accuracy.

Additionally, we provide analysis results to evaluate the impact of various components within our framework and highlight the role of adversarial learning in object detection tasks.

1 Introduction

Object detection is a strong and important role in visual recognition. It is widely used in product analysis tasks for object detectors. Existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant performance in feature extraction and classification. Recent work focuses on enhancing attention mechanisms, improving feature consistency, and elevating detection accuracy. Additional situational factors also influence accuracy.

2 Related Work

Standard object detection architectures include Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLO. These related models implement convolutional neural networks and demonstrate enhanced feature transfer strategies. Adversarial networks (GANs), spatial transformer networks (STNs), and representation learning approaches (MLAD, NEST) improve transformations of adversarial feature generation and integration in terms of robustness.

Figure 1

Proposed dual stream adversarial feature learning framework.

Figure 2

Image examples showing the behavior of detection models during adversarial feature learning. The adversarial examples introduce subtle perturbations that influence the detector.

3 Proposed Method

First, a dual stream architecture: feature and generator streams. Our method integrates the dual stream approach into an object detector backbone. The adversarial generator network introduces controlled perturbations to enhance robustness. The detector learns to separate genuine features from generated perturbations, improving both resilience and interpretability.

By overestimating the object architecture using a combined adversarial network, we encourage feature refinement through training convolutional neural layers. This enhances the ability to capture detailed spatial patterns during testing. The adversarial generator introduces variable but consistent distortions, enabling improved generalization. The baseline detector becomes more stable and efficient for consistent inference.

Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel self supervised learning framework utilizing transformer networks for intuitive image representation learning. Our approach leverages the power of transformers for capturing long range dependencies, which enables efficient self supervised learning. We introduce a combination of training objectives and technical mechanisms designed to enhance feature consistency across images. Experimental results show that multiple benchmarks and unsupervised performance tests achieve state of the art performance on image classification and extended tasks, surpassing established baselines.

1. Introduction

Recent advances in self supervised learning (SSL) have shown good promise in reducing the gap between supervised and unsupervised representation learning. SSL traditionally relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vectorized pretext tasks such as rotation, jigsaw prediction, and contrastive learning. CNNs are extremely limited in modeling long range dependencies due to their forward receptive fields. This motivates transformer architectures, which have gained significant success in natural language processing and are increasingly adopted in computer vision for their ability to model global context.

2. Method
2.1 Self Supervised Learning Framework

Our proposed self supervised transformer network comprises two primary components: learning objectives and network modules. The interaction between them defines the coherence of our approach, which we detail in the following subsections.

Figure 1

Overview of our self supervised transformer network for image representation learning, enabling transfer to supervised and unsupervised tasks while jointly enhancing image features in a self supervised manner.

Figure 2

Masked image modeling and contrastive learning framework. The combined training objective enforces consistency of learned representations.

2.2 Vision Transformer Backbone

At the core of our approach is the Vision Transformer (ViT), which we adapt to the backbone for learning representations. ViT embeds an input image into a series of patches and projects them into a value space, then sequences them into a set of tokens. These tokens are processed through multiple transformer layers, forming the essential component of our approach, detailed below.

3. Experiments
3.1 Experimental Setup

Datasets. We evaluate our method on standard image representation benchmarks, including ImageNet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and COCO.

Preprocessing. We apply random cropping, horizontal flipping, color jittering, and normalization for the contrastive training branch, and random masking for the masked image modeling branch.

Abstract

This proposal presents a Transformer based approach for generating image descriptions using captured transformer mechanisms. It leverages the cross attention mechanism in optimizing model training, generating descriptions of training objects, and conducting experiments on the COCO and Flickr8k datasets. This achieves state of the art performance in unimodal network efficiency due to computational parallelism and high sample efficiency due to the elimination of specific modifications.

1 Introduction

Automatic generation of natural language descriptions of images advances through sequence to sequence models with recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Instead of training approximations, we explore threading and visualizing model feature dependence for improvement tasks and overall comparative performance.

2 Approach
2.1 Transformer Architecture

In our proposed model, we use the Transformer architecture with a visual encoder (a CNN). The CNN processes input images into feature maps, which are projected into the Transformer encoder using a nonlinear attention method. The decoder generates sequences using cross attention between encoder output and decoder states.

Abstract

In focus on semantic segmentation, it proposes a self supervised learning approach using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). For segmentation, we use it to generate labels using contrastive learning tasks to optimize the performance of spatial processing selectors by spatially promoted relationships between past embeddings, aggregation (cross notation effects), and a refinement approach to integrating self supervised pre training into the overall segmentation architecture. It induces performance improvement on benchmark datasets and improves efficiency.

1 Introduction

The task of semantic segmentation covers using deep ConvNets to densely accumulate useful representations. Learned embeddings rely on large scale datasets in supervised context. Network labeling is not scalable, yielding the need for code based recognition factors and dataloaders, and for this purpose, self supervised learning methods research dedicated prediction losses. Although notational performance arises from emerging efficiency, it reduces dense prediction in downstream tasks.

1 Introduction (duplicate OCR block preserved)

Considering our approach, segmentation approaches promote consistent and separate, intensively labeled methods, by associating describing items within images. There is concatenation of self supervised learning methods reflecting that the approach is developing segmentation in dense prediction tasks.

2 Approach

Our self supervised approach is an applied approach.

2.1 Self Supervised Pre Training

In our pre training self supervised segmentation approach, it provides a method that intends to be flexible in finding the ties between labeled imbalances within images of dense maps and contrastive learning tasks, providing distinct defined semantic relations to enhance segmentation profiles.
